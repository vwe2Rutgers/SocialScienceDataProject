It seemed dry and calculated. I miss they Marry Me/Actor days where her performances seemed more raw and there was this great juxtaposition between the sweet Annie Clark that would talk and sing and the musical monster that would come out through her guitar. It was this kind of underlying madness that made Annie's music so chilling. I also miss her old band, they had such character--where's the sax and clarinet and violin? It was, in part, their contrast against Annie's mad guitar playing that created such an ominous feeling. I think this performance confirms that I'd never want to see St. Vincent perform live again.

An American Prayer is the ninth and final studio album by the Doors. In 1978, seven years after lead singer Jim Morrison died and five years after the remaining members of the band broke up, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore reunited and recorded backing tracks over Morrison's poetry (originally recorded in 1969 and 1970). Other pieces of music and spoken word recorded by the Doors and Morrison were also used in the audio collage, such as dialogue from Morrison's film HWY: An American Pastoral and snippets from jam sessions.

The album also includes a composite live version of ""Roadhouse Blues,"" splicing together performances at New York City's Felt Forum and Detroit's Cobo Hall, both captured during the Doors' 1970 Roadhouse Blues Tour.

Personally, I can't say that I'm a huge fan of emo/pop punk inspired stuff (just saying that based on the emo vs pop punk playlist on your spotify artist page) but objectively this stuff is pretty good and you're taking it beyond just emo/pop punk. I especially like that you've got little synths here and there and cool shit like the violin part on ""I Miss You"". Like someone said, I definitely hear some Death Cab influence too. Good job.

|**name**|[**Andrew Jackson Jihad**](http://radd.it/music/artist/andrewjacksonjihad)|  
|**about artist**|Andrew Jackson Jihad is an American folk/punk/rock group from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2004. They have been classified as everything from indie rock to anti-folk to Americana.  Andrew Jackson Jihad was formed after its original drummer, Justin James White, approached Sean Bonnette and Ben Gallaty, who had just left Rodan (not the Rodan of Kentucky fame) and The Sub-Standards. Since then, many significant Arizona musicians have sat in with the remaining duo of Sean and Ben, including John De La Cruz of Fatigo and Asleep In The Sea's Owen Evans.

[American Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONbooypFSd4):This is one of the albums that Malkmus contributed guitar and vocals to, as demonstrated on [People.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5q0rupfENc)

[Bright Flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZWNaGIsBcY): This album showed a more folk and country influence on their sound, including a cover of [George Strait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8_K5dOUlHI).

[Tanglewood Numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtA869eH21c): This album has both Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich contributing to the music, and is more of a rock album than Bright Flight. However, [the country elements are still present](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyoNtnB84iQ).

I hope this helps, and I hope you like at least some of their output. Overall, if I had to pick one album to start with, I'd give it to *American Water*, just barely edging out *Bright Flight*. But that's just me.","51_1_1"

|**artist**|The Mountain Goats|  
|**about artist**|The Mountain Goats is the musical project of singer-songwriter and guitarist John Darnielle. The New Yorker magazine referred to him as &amp;quot;Americas best non-hip-hop lyricist.&amp;quot; In its June 2006 issue, Paste magazine named Darnielle one of the &amp;quot;100 Best Living Songwriters.&amp;quot; Darnielles lyrics are literate and filled with imagery that reference classic literature, religion and mythologies, pop culture, art, and history. Others are vague references to his stepfather, and with the 2005 album The Sunset Tree Darnielle offered a more intimate account of his experience as an abused child.

Don't get me wrong. There are absolute classics on this list. However, in my opinion, it is missing a lot of the mid-00s bangers. Such as, for instance, ""Apply some Pressure"" by Maximo Park, anything off of Bloc Party's debut ""Silent Alarm"", ""Nobody Move Nobody Get Hurt"" by We Are Scientists, ""Strasbourg"" or ""22 Grand Job"" by The Rakes, anything by Babyshambles, early Kaiser Chiefs, Editors, The Maccabees, The Pigeon Detectives, The View, Razorlight, The Futureheads, early Foals, Mystery Jets, Klaxons, The Bravery, Franz Ferdinand, early Kasabian,... And surely, you can't omit The Libertines in an ""essential Indie"" list :)  

And by the way: ""Lonerism"" by Tame Impala was released in 2012. You could include ""Solitude Is Bliss"" or other songs from ""Innerspeaker"", which was released in 2010.","1"

I think taking the top 50 albums with fewer songs from each would make a playlist where you really get a taste of everything from the 2000s.

Pausing and restarting at the same point would be difficult if you shuffled it. What I tend to do is start a playlist at the first song, unselect shuffle and when I'm done just remember what song I was on and use it as a sort of bookmark to find my place later.

Got pulled in to selling Grimes' merchandise when I was originally supposed to be conducting an interview/meeting about a job with somebody - I make a quick $30 doing low-efficiency labor, why not? 

This is on March 4 of last year, so this is shortly after Oblivion came out. She sold out this 250 cap room and it was packed like sardines. Born Gold opens, then she takes the stage. An hour+ later, she ended her set finally and the crowd goes crazy. 

The merchandise table was literally situated right next to the stage. A massive line forms and she, of course, tends to it. She's signing CDs, LPs, shirts and she's taking photos with people. She seems like an alright person - mind you, this is when Hipster Runoff was posting numerous scandalous pictures involving her so these were rather fresh in my mind. 

Anyhow, she's literally standing right next to me for the next 45 minutes while I'm selling people her goods. This... foul aroma came by almost as soon as she appeared... like, the smell of fat, sweaty basement dweller who doesn't know the existence of deodorant. It's horrid but I'll deal with it - this is easy money (and money I needed since I didn't hold a consistent job) and I'm taking a gap semester in school. The maw finally dies down. She tells me a meek ""thanks for doing this."" I nod in appreciation, as I'm trying to keep my nausea under control. Magically, the smell disappears.

A few days later, I see this video on Dazed and Confused where she conducted an interview. She made full note that she believes ""people are too clean"" and ""she only showers once or twice a week."" 

My eyes were wide open.","3_1"

the album was also very derivative and uninspired, even by emo standards. it does literally nothing new or interesting. there have been bands recently that have been combining emo with other genres (like pity sex with shoegaze), yet whenever if ever is just the same old twinkly guitar, simple/catchy riffs, etc etc. i should also say that that's not necessarily a bad thing and i don't hate this album. i like it; i just can't fathom how it's gotten the amount of praise it has.

IMO, it's up there with ""Funeral"" because these two albums were two new and different approaches in making rock music, but both went in two completely separate directions. You find more electronics in Wolf Parade - more cathartic rock, more synths and keys, versus the more organic and acoustic Arcade Fire (though synths were evident on Funeral, they were subdued and less of a key element than seen in WP).

BIRP is a monthly compilation of +100 tracks that are free to stream / download.

His attitude towards women is deplorable, but the irony of it being met with applause is devastating. This turd is a by product of the absolute most garbage generation of all time, but that doesnt quit encapsulate how badly we fucked up. I often find myself in a cold sweat halfway through his peach scone video wondering how I got there. Its starting to effect my relationships. My friends, my family, my peers and coworkers, everywhere I look its Hobo Johnson this and Hobo Johnson that. Ive started to examine these feelings I have, and its terrifying. Am I just jealous that my own shitty projects didnt go viral? Have I treated women like that before too? Im a part of this shit generation as well, Who am I to say this music is bad? Is the camera going out of focus every 5 seconds in his videos on purpose? His hair reminds me of my hair. Theres something about his face that makes me hate my face. Do I just hate Hobo Johnson because I hate myself? If I start screaming right now, who will listen? Look at me! I spent 20 minutes at 5am writing an essay about how much I hate this man, and I have nothing to show for it. I came to this group looking for answers. All I found is people with bad music taste, who believe themselves to have good music taste because they hate Hobo Johnson. While it is comforting to see others struggling with these issues as I am, it is simultaneously fucking with me really hard because now my entire newsfeed is nothing but Hobo Johnson, which perpetuates the cycle. Ive thought about killing myself or Hobo Johnson, but then my entire life meaning would have been about Hobo Johnson. A catch 22 wherein my very existence and purpose revolves around the thing I hate most. How very Hobo Johnson of me.","14"

So, one potential benefit& a band releases an album on the channels you talk about, but they have a couple of special versions of songs they could release as an NFT. Fans want collectibles of bands they really support. Those collectibles are rarities and can be bought and resold for a higher value, and with royalties the band will make a decent amount just on those collectibles. Thats one method.","7_1_1"

The benefit of streams, on the consumer side, is that you can effectively try the record before you commit to it, the problem is that the individual can't really buy the record a lot of the times, limiting earnings potential. I see these as two extreme ends with no real middle ground for unestablished and true indie acts.","8"

Is it worth a try? Hell yeah. I mean anything is in its infancy. We are all in a position where we should be daring and go for something alien. It could pay off. Just not totally convinced after looking into it last night. 

Honestly, in the digital age, you can't make much money on music, even some real big acts don't take home all that much. In the end, you gotta do the shit for love and passion.

Its leaning way too  much towards that melodic juice wrld, post Malone, Mac Miller type singing. Keep it indie. Keep the simplistic lyrics and simple melody because thats what is popular. Add some flair with textured synth pad over it or something. Instead of leaning towards the melodic rap, lean towards a more Mac Demarco, boy pablo,, Day Wave type sound.

(e.g. While you may just really like The Lonesome, Crowded West, my speculation is that This Is A Long Drive would have made a greater impact on you if you were slightly older than 38.) Other giveaways of this demographic may be: the Pitchfork Best Albums picks, although I guess no one was completely impervious to some of those choices. The only thing that is crossing me up are the R.E.M.; Dinosaur Jr. and Smashing Pumpkins (and possibly Belle &amp; Sebastian) picks bc I do think here is some sort of discernible shut off pertaining to this music with regards to specific age groups, but then what do I know?

|**about artist**|Previously known as Now, Now Every Children from Blaine, Minnesota.  Threads  the second full-length release from Minneapolis based Now, Now  explores the fragile and often transitory nature of our existence, our perceived understanding of the world around us and relationships shared with others physically and emotionally. Produced by Howard Redekopp (Tegan and Sara, An Horse, New Pornographers), Threads forms a sprawling sonic endeavor that showcases the bands incredible growth as songwriters and musicians.

|**about artist**|The Naked and Famous are a five piece indie band hailing from Auckland, New Zealand. The band comprises Thom Powers, Alisa Xayalith, Aaron Short, David Beadle and Jesse Wood. According to the Young Blood Songfacts, they took the name from a line in UK trip hop singer-songwriter Tricky's track, Tricky Kid.  After their initial formation in 2008, their debut album &amp;quot;Passive Me, Aggressive You&amp;quot; was released on the &amp;quot;Somewhat Damaged&amp;quot; label during September 2010. The single &amp;quot;Young Blood&amp;quot; debuted at number one on the New Zealand chart - the first New Zealand artist to do so in three years.

The only adjustments would be to dampen the snare and kick  to give more breathing space for the other instruments, but that's just  nitpicking.  

The criticism was aimed towards the 2nd half of the song.  The contrast between the melody and the rhythm doesn't work in my opinion, and theres so much potential.  If you were to slow down on the hi-hat and fill more of the sound with accents such as rolls on the Toms or ride symbol, it would work in unison  with the melody.

Im really impressed with how theyve kind of taken inspiration from some bigger indie groups like Glass Animals, alt-J and Jungle (their falsetto-heavy sound is really reminiscent of Jungle imo) while still seemingly carving out their own space in the scene as well.

It's really good music to study to or just to have playing during a chill night hanging out with your friends.

If you liked this song, I would suggest take you home, gray, anemone, lucid, and/or queen (all song names). Honestly though, I haven't listened to a song of theirs that I haven't liked--those are just a few of my favorites. 

[Here is their entire discography on Spotify.](https://open.spotify.com/user/slenderbodies/playlist/2kPt5RA0Gmc1zFpiK7GGnh?si=ZjQiJ8brSwisnRv7mZspxA) It's only a little longer than an hour, so they definitely don't have a ton of content yet, but hopefully we get a full-length album in the not-too-distant future.

|**artist**|[Portugal. The Man](http://radd.it/music/artist/portugaltheman)|  
|**about artist**|Portugal. The Man is an experimental indie rock four-piece centered on frontman John Baldwin Gourleys abstract musical approach and corresponding upbringing. He was raised in a sort of technological isolation: his log cabin home in the winter wasteland of the fringes of Wasilla, Alaska was powered by a generator and had no telephone. Both of his parents helped completely immerse him in the unique lifestyle that comes with a land of seasonal darkness and perpetual cold with their jobs as dog sled mushers.

|**artist**|[**Nada Surf**](http://radd.it/music/artist/nadasurf)|  
|**about artist**|Nada Surf is an American alternative rock group formed in 1992. The New York band consists of Matthew Caws (guitar, vocals), Ira Elliot (drums, vocals) and Daniel Lorca (bass, vocals).   The band is best known for the song &amp;quot;Popular&amp;quot; from their 1996 album High/Low. The song reached #11 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and propelled the album to #63 on the Billboard 200. Each of the verses in &amp;quot;Popular&amp;quot; are extracted from the 1964 guide &amp;quot;Penny's Guide to Teen-Age Charm and Popularity&amp;quot; by former teen television actress Gloria Winters - and is sarcastically spoken - initially in a calm... ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Nada Surf))|  
|**album**|**High/Low**, released Jun 1996|  
|**track**|**Popular**|  
|**about track**|Popular is Nada Surf's first radio single, released in June 1996. Each of the verses in Popular presents, in spoken word format, sarcastic advice to teens. Initially offered in a calm, deadpan voice, the lyrics gradually build Kinison-style in teen angst and rage.  The song reached number 11 on the U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and propelled the album to number 63 on the Billboard 200. Popular was also a big hit in France, reaching the Top 10 with a total chart run of 15 consecutive weeks in the French Top 50. It was also used in France in a TV commercial for the radio station Fun Radio, which was then the most influential radio station among teenagers.   The whole song, except for the chorus, is made of parts of a book, Penny's Guide to Teen-Age Charm and Popularity (Gloria Winters, 1964, Prentice Hall), whose advice are taken sarcastically by Matthew Caws. Those parts are spoken, and not sung.   A rerecorded version from 2007 appears on the band's MySpace.  Video and controversy  The video for this song, directed by Jesse Peretz, was shot at the Bayonne High School, with administration approval, and showed football players and cheerleaders, wearing the uniforms of the school, as well as the three members of the band, Matthew as a teacher, Daniel as a security guard, and Ira as the football coach.  The vice principal of the High School later launched a controversy, in mid-August 1996, by raising the issue that the last scene, which shows football players staring suggestively at each other in the showers, was homoerotic and thus offensive towards Bayonne High School, as it suggested some of its football players could be gay.  According to Nada Surf, the shower scene was never intended to suggest homosexuality. Indeed, both the song's lyrics and the bulk of the video's imagery are predominantly  and blatantly  heterosexual. The video features passionate, heterosexual kissing scenes, for example, which go well beyond any &amp;quot;suggestive&amp;quot; smiles that so offended the vice principal.  Significantly, the band members quickly took exception to this homophobic attack. During an MTV News report on the controversy, Nada Surf lambasted the vice principal's ignorance  calling the vice principal &amp;quot;small minded&amp;quot; for singling out &amp;quot;homoeroticism as more offensive than straight eroticism&amp;quot;.|

I'm a fairly new artist too, but if you're wondering about promotion the very first thing you should do is prepare a ""press statement"", to send to all the radios, megazines, and music Instagram and Facebook pages, so they can check out your stuff and choose to promote it. 
You should include info about you, your song/album, who produced it, who's distributing it, the cover, a link to listen to it, and like a short comment on it so people can just copy and paste it if they choose to like write an article about it.
If you want some more info feel free to DM me :)","7"

(CNN)Both members of UK indie band Her's have been killed in a car crash in Arizona, the duo's record label said Friday.
Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading were killed along with their tour manager, Trevor Engelbrektson, early Wednesday, according to the Heist or Hit record label.
The Liverpool group, who described themselves as an ""international supersonic spectral wave,"" was midway through a 19-gig North American tour to promote their debut album, ""Invitation to Her's.""

They had performed in Phoenix, Arizona on Tuesday and were traveling 350 miles to Santa Ana, California for their next scheduled performance when the crash happened.
The collision took place on Interstate 10 around 1 a.m., and the Arizona Department of Public Safety reported that four people were killed when a pickup truck collided head-on with the band's passenger van.
All three people in the van were killed, along with the driver of the pickup.""

First of all, they make their own music and have a band, so they're not a ""leech"" they want to contribute to the community and positively impact others with their music. Which is WHY they made the site to begin with. 

They immediately fixed the issue that THEY DIDNT EVEN KNOW WAS THERE, and is way more mindful of shit like that now. Who's to say you wouldnt have made the same mistake creating a website so people who share your hobby can post and form a community???

&gt;Who's to say you wouldnt have made the same mistake creating a website so people who share your hobby can post and form a community???

If I was operating a business and my customers were agreeing to terms of service, you bet your ass I would have read them. To not do so is gross negligence. 

&gt;The fact that you're so hostile and judge someone so harshly 

I judge people who behave in a way that allows this to happen, yes. There are plenty of mistakes to be made, but this is something that could have been avoided by doing the absolute bare minimum I would expect of someone in their position.

When you open yourself up to a client base and have people putting their trust in you, you have a responsibility to understand what you're asking of them. 

I apologize for how harsh I was, but I stand by my statement that people who are incapable of doing the bare minimum in this way are unfit to be running any sort of website or business like this. Sorry, but it's true. I'm glad they learned their lesson, but they deserved the criticism they got.","1_2_1_1_1_1"

They didnt deserve the harassment, bullying and complete bash on their character. To frame it in a way of oh we were just rightfully criticizing a mistake when 99% of the users who replied and much of what was said was WAY out of line. 

And again, its still in very early stages, and people are capable of learning. To completely shun someones ability to make something great based off their first and only mistake is insane. 

I hope you dont ever receive such harsh backlash when you fail once on something you genuinely care for. However, maybe you need to go through it to understand how wrong everyone was and how they handled it. Even when u/vallygally was being completely professional.

It is a business, lol. I'm not saying it's a big business. I'm saying that the practices they used were very easily predatory and it requires giving the benefit of the doubt to a total stranger in an incredibly predatory industry in order to even consider overlooking that. And, even if you do give them the benefit of the doubt, the absolute best case scenario is gross negligence.

No, you're right about that.

It's a mistake that can only be made by somebody who is not making even the slightest effort to protect the people who use the website. It's not insane to lose faith in a person who makes a mistake *like that*.

Then again IMO, during sex you don't really have the mental capacity or at least shouldn't have to be focusing on the words. Unless it's something extremely funny or offensive or alarming or something.  *side note* this one time I was having sex with my partner and we were watching a stand up special on TV, things got hot and heavy and we did not bother shutting it off. Halfway through sex the comedian says the hilarious joke and we both start laughing. Then promptly shut it off. ","6_1"

That's one of the last things I care about when listening to music I love. It's only important when I'm discovering new music, I'd like for it to be genuine; and if it's a song I know, sometimes it's fun to sing along.

The 1st track just sounds too prominent, like *let's get it on* music. It's a little cliche I guess, which obviously I won't be critiquing music when having sex but it's like this dude is in between the covers telling me to enjoy it haha

Trying to explain why I don't like this song for sexing to sounds a bit dumb when putting it in words, but here's an example: the 2nd track is awesome and I'd be comfortable with it because it's both unique and very sexy but I could listen to it on a morning bus ride without thinking of sex at all.

I personally LOVE three pickup Telecasters. A lot of country players mod this guitar, but you could go anywhere you wanted with it. The stock pickups aren't bad at all, but if you found a player whose sound you wanted to emulate, you could swap them to match their guitar very easily.

Also, Phoebe is playing a Danelectro baritone these days that you can find for $400 used if you're lucky. If you like the Telecaster vibe, I recently picked up the Paranormal Series Baritone from Squier for that price new, and sold one that was way more expensive. It was no contest.","8_1_1_1_1"

I use Ableton. The saxophone on the second track is played by a friend of mine, but you can find really good samples on Splice, it costs 8 usd per month but it worth it!

Respect at the sound, I took some lesson with a friend of mine for mixing and mastering.

Imparting more realism onto organic string Kontakt libraries has been my focus for the past couple of weeks. I kept finding myself dissatisfied with how much tweaking, layering, and modulation was necessary to yield a dynamic, believable sound. Cassette tape seems to provide some solutions. Running the signal particularly hot into the machine's mixing console laces the strings in crisp distortion that doesn't feel overbearing. Nuance is introduced through the reactive nature of tape (it's response to live reverb being sent to the source signal, dropouts, grime, etc). Naturally slowing down the progression &amp; panning each layer on tape opens up the stereo field in an interesting way, intimate but still distant. 

  
Happy to answer any questions regarding the processing, modulation &amp; approach to production here. Cheers!

I've seen them 4 times including once at Red Rocks where they had to delay their set by over an hour due to a huge storm coming through but they refused to cancel and we waited it out in the downpour for it to pass and so glad we did because it was one of the best live sets I've ever been too.","12_1"

I'd say that's crazy but tbh I can sorta see how that would happen at a Leon show, the man dances like an absolute maniac lol. I listened to a podcast with him and learned that before he did music he was studying to be a dancer so I guess that explains it.

Its not nearly as serious but my crazy Leon story is that my GF and I were in New Orleans at a music festival (which Leon wasn't even playing at). After the shows for that night ended we went to Frenchmen street to get drinks and when we got outside the bar there was a big jazz band playing in the street blocking traffic with like hundreds of people dancing in the intersection. We walked up to check out the band and at the center of the crowd dancing like crazy was Leon! We had just seen him like a month earlier and got to dance in the crowd with him for like an hour and take a pic together. He was just there hanging out with his tour guitarist who lives in the city, and like most of the people in the crowd had no clue who he was. Was an amazing moment.","14_1"

It's totally cohesive, each song flows into each other. The live versions are totally unique to the studio versions. The effort and quality put into their ""screen projection"" visuals is top notch. The motion of the crowd, the sensory overload, the one time I saw them in an optimal venue was easy top 3 concert experiences of my life.","81"

We were sitting in the grass,  having a beer, surrounded by all these other super cool indie kids... Anyway, she made me this mixtape which featured this song. Also featured.. let's see. Pinback, Death Cab for Cutie, Damien Rice, Sufjan Stevens... Tons I don't remember the name of. And a lot of unknown swedish indie. Maybe I'll see if I can find the mixtape one day.

I went to Hawaii a few years ago and as I was snorkeling I found a sea urchin and my 16 year old self wanted to keep it as a pet. I brought it back to the hotel and obviously it died by the time we got back. 

Anyways, I took a video of me flushing it down the toilet to this song. Ill try to find the video and link it.

I hope you don't mind my saying this, but I think for your next song you and your gf could add more shots and editing to the music video to better suit the complexity of the music you produce.

First test with the Sony Clear Voice Plus microcassette player + a cheap violin I picked up via local thrift shop. I've been trying to inch closer and closer to the sound design philosophy of folks like Lapalux, who really know how to interweave these sprawling soundscapes without feeling overbearing. I recorded the strings directly to DAW, bounced to microcassette (recording at its highest speed), bounced back to in-DAW &amp; applied delay/reverb/eq, etc. Some additional synth patches were ran directly into the CVP at its slowest speed to yield some really neat signal degradation. Here's a demo of the unit working its magic.

I had gotten their vinyl not long after discovering them to support them and with the intention of meeting them and getting it signed whenever they inevitably came around to my area.

I hate how senseless of a way we lost them. I'll never understand the mentality of people who drive drunk. I'm saying this as a person who enjoys drinking as well.

My favorite songs by ween off the top of my head are ""The Argus,"" ""Voodoo Lady,"" ""Transdermal Celebration,"" ""The Mollusk,"" ""Buckingham Green,"" ""Flutes of Chi,"" ""Chocolate Town,"" and ""Roses are Free."" 

""Voodoo Lady"" is probably the one I've listened to most but mostly the live versions and the same goes for ""Roses Are Free."" A lot of weens best work is definitely in their live performances so I'd highly recommend watching their Live in Chicago dvd (its on youtube) which is in my opinion their best performance thats on video. That show was also released as an album and is on streaming services though its missing a good bit of the songs that the dvd had","7_1_1"

* [Bülow ](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5vBrKGOjN10BMwB0cJADj4?si=BF57n5F4QNOOQsEdkyRk7Q&amp;dl_branch=1) who is a - alt/indie-pop sound. I recommend You &amp; Jennifer, Revolver, and Not a Love Song

* [Stop Light Observations](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2EOIjdzbFGRM87IvJU34JJ?si=BXD8b2UYRVChKI-q-ICxPw&amp;dl_branch=1) - people are sleeping on this artists. They can be accurately described as an amalgamation classic rock and roll, indie, motown, hip-hop, folk, revival, psychedelic, and garage. The TOOGOODOO is my favorite album, but all their music is solid: 2young, Aquarius Apocalyptic, Dinosaur Bones shows how wide their genre-mashing goes. 

* [Donna Missal](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4QFHHdZkeqmneDQqKIjAN8?si=osaSC7IMRy-bJMYas3nCmQ&amp;dl_branch=1) - HOLY CRAP if you want to hear a powerful woman with pipes that goes from alt/indie/rock to indie-pop. My favorite from her is [Keep Lying - the live version](https://youtu.be/ad3qqlZThl4) (&lt;- YT link) which has a raw gritty feel, and Girl which is more on the pop-indie side.","22"

Theyre really close in sound. 

I dont know if Outlaw Country is the indie version of Country, but I would highly recommend giving [Cody Jinks](https://open.spotify.com/track/6VChAU4QENeLwf3OaHBJxC?si=pAt1KsWCRWCIgw-uukiX6A&amp;dl_branch=1) a listen (coming from someone who hates most modern country).

I understand you, it is a normal fear. However, don't let it beat you up. Take the time you need to create and you will never know until you dive in. 

I also would like to create and don't worry about the number of ''play'' or positive feedback. But thing is, as artists we work for a public, so we need to have feedback because not only this is what help us to grow, but the very reason what we're doing is other than just a hobby.

Theres always this way of no looking at it: say, 300k tracks are uploaded to streaming services weekly. That might seem like a ton, however, on one hand, there are some 4.66 billion internet users at the moment, so that is far less than one new song per user per week. So your chances of connecting with an audience- if thats what you want-are still fairly reasonable. 

Add to this the fact that, since there really is no gatekeeper to uploading music to streaming services, there really is no bar of quality to speak of. Likely most of those tracks uploaded weekly are just not gonna connect with anyone in a meaningful way. 

So post your music with out fomo in your heart! When youre ready. Make it for you. I say post it- release it. And heres why; when your hd crashes, you wont lose the stuff thats out there- in physical and digital form. I wish I had done this- I lost 200 demos -and many finished!- to a double HD failure- the perfect storm! 

There are so many reasons to fell somewhat optimistic about the state of affairs. I started playing in the 90s and I basically have no record of most of that older stuff due to deterioration of all kinds. If I had ordered cassettes and 7 of whatever I was working on the time Id probably still have some of it. Imagine if we had had streaming in the 90s If its on all the streaming services, those recordings would be an amazing heirloom to remind yourself of who youve been. I couldnt have imagined the way technology has made recording so accessible when I was 10. 

So dont worry about it too much, you do you and take advantage of all this fantastically accessible recording technology and go make something you like.","7"

The ""I want this to reach everyone!"" And. ""I just want the song to be good first and foremost."" 

The reality is most of us won't really be heard by the world I think. So I guess don't let your mind take away from your joy of creating songs/don't let those thoughts trespass into your studio or wherever you make music.

Sometimes you need to think about it just to process it but always remember you can't control others just yourself and be happy you can create songs.","8"

|**name**|[**Alt-J**](http://radd.it/music/artist/badtag)|  
|**about artist**| (pronounced Alt-J) was formed when Gwil Sainsbury (guitarist/bassist) , Joe Newman (guitar/vocals), Gus Unger-Hamilton (keyboards) and Thom Green (drums) met at Leeds, UK University in 2007. The band currently resides in Cambridge.  Gus studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art.  In their second year of studies, Joe showed Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on Garageband.

Still, I know the feeling, and I am glad this works for you like it works for me. I hope the next bit works better for you. My band released a single onto Spotify for Solas Festival, which was cancelled like everything else, but they put together a programme and kept us as a part of it (amazing, since we only got the gig because we are local).

Impressively full sounding for doing it all yrself. You've got a nice voice! Drums are solid. Mixing's well-done and well-thought, too. 

Really like how you kind rush the words in the chorus, too, gives it a nice rush and momentum.

I'd find myself at home alone listening to REM, Buffy Saint Marie, Donovan, Grateful Dead,  Ween, Camper Van Beethoven etc. After a Bad Brains or a Butthole Surfers show.  . Or exploring my dads Jazz and Classical albums. Days on end in used bins just hoovering up Anything that even LOOKed interesting.  

   Anyways. Hope yer life is edifying and pleasantly weird. . .  I wonder is the any groups here that are specifically for musical eclecticism? I want to share certain lists or artists. But , technically,  sometimes not alll ""Indie"". 

  Like this one. Alll WOMEN artists who have moved me in Some way , shape or form over my life. It's almost as eclectic as possible.  Other than Reggae and Jazz, which I just touch upon, it's every genre imaginable that managed to swirl it's way into my view. Probs Ought to be 7 or 8 lists. Skips all over time but runs in genre and style themes. From sweet folk to nastyass Booty House. Blues, Funk to Indie and hardcore. Experimental compositional electronice to Metal . I dunno. Enjoy if you wanna =<U+009E> and would LOVE if anyone wants to push Their faves on me.

It has a special place in my heart because of why it was written. Dan Reynolds has said in interview that it's associated a period of depression he was in that was also related to his struggle with chronic illness. He has Ulcerative Colitis and Anklosing Spondylitis. I don't have anklosing spondylitis (yet--5-10% of cases are in people with preexisting IBD) but I do have ulcerative colitis. To be honest, this song came when I was in a similar position with my autoimmune disease and it hit me so hard when I learned this that I cried. There's very few public figures that have my disease that I know of and I really needed that at the time.

I'm not going to pretend that every lyric in this song is super deep and connected to this meaning. Dan Reynolds has applied the song to several different things. It definitely got overplayed and I understand why a lot of people dislike it. I just wanted to drop in and give an alternate perspective on the song, and why I still like it","3_1_2"

I havent seen any articles or high profile reviews of their music and I think thats a real shame. Theyre also as indie as they come: the band started when the guys would get together after work to drink beer and jam, bought their own studio time, and never signed on with a record label.

|**about artist**|As Shakey Graves, Rose-Garcia from Austin, Texas, He plays a gnarly composite of blues and folk as a one-man-band of epic sonic proportions. The sound emitted from his hollow body guitar, mildly distorted amp and suitcase drum belie the young singers lean frame. He fingerpicks while keeping time with a double-pedal kick drum, hitting a snare fitted into his suitcase drum and a tambourine fashioned to its side. And when he sings, Rose-Garcia unleashes an unearthly howl. ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/Shakey Graves))|

I have a hard time keeping my strumming consistent while singing so it's not as clean as I'd like it to be, and since I couldn't change the volume for the guitar without making my voice quieter, it put me in a tough spot when I was mixing. I definitely need to re-record it and separate the tracks  so I don't have that problem, and switch up the strumming like you said so it's not as bland.

First, you have a great voice, and I think it is awesome that you are putting yourself out there.  I wont offer you advice in relation to your song, as I am pretty confident youll be just fine if you keep it up.  

Id like to offer some advice from a more general sense, that I wish someone had told me when I was in college.  

1.) Do not be afraid to put yourself out there.  Self-promote.  

I play over 130 gigs a year, and I have a grand total of 144 likes on Facebook.  The thought of self-promotion has always been nauseating to me, and its something that I still struggle with.  With that being said, Ive learned that you can be an adequate musician, and be extremely successful, if you are able to create a relationship with your audience.  I let everything out when I play, and play with every ounce of emotion in my soul, but I struggle with small talk and creating a relationship with the audience.  Ive always hated small-talk, and found it to be ingenuine.  But people will want to know who you are... theres a happy medium somewhere in between, and Im hoping to find eventually.  Its something I continue to work on.  If you start now, youll be well ahead of me when youre 33.

2.). Bring your guitar everywhere.  

Play at parties, for your friends, family, busk... 

3.) Dont be discouraged by the negativity, because it will be there.  Youll be heckled, laughed at, and put down (I was many, many times) but let it motivate you, and let it fuel the fire.  

2 and 3 desensitized me to playing out.  The nerves are good nerves now, and propel me in a positive manner because of those prior experiences.

4.) Write, record, write, record... youre in college right now and while things get busy, they only get busier as you get older.  I have two daughters, a 9-5 and am a musician.  I have hundreds of songs that are half completed because my schedule is not very flexible these days.  Its to the point that even the thought of sifting through them seems like an arduous task.  Take advantage of the time you have, when you have it.  

5.) Im not sure if you drink or whatever, but do not fall into that hole.  Society yearns for extroverts, and during college, drinks helped me accommodate societys wishes.  But you grow even more susceptible to depending on that crutch, to be someone youre not, as you grow older, and it could prove to be an issue. Coffee works much better for creativity.

6.) Never forget this song, where you started.  Youre going to grow a ton, and get frustrated a ton in the process.  But remember why you play music in the first place...its fun.  And to some of us, its our therapy.

I have a ton more, and maybe Ill edit a bit later, but its soccer time for my little lady. 

Keep rockin man, and have fun doing it.

Unique sound with a solid, uncomplicated identity that would definitely have a fanbase for sure.  Performance is spot on, and the songwriting itself flows relatively well and is pretty catchy for that kind of thing.

To echo others' sentiments, definitely invest in some better recording equipment.  This doesn't sound terrible by any means, so don't take that too much to heart, but there's definitely a lot of ways something even as simple as this could be made into so much more with slightly better gear...you'd be surprised.  I'd like to see people with talent set themselves up for success as much as possible.

It doesn't take much...get a couple midrange mics, a decent recording interface, some good software, etc.  I know it's tough as a college student, but a few hundred bucks goes a long way these days.

If nothing else, you could always just book a few hours of studio time and let others handle that end of things until you get in a better financial spot where you can invest in yourself long term with gear.

Good luck, my man.

Do you think there are any decent mics I could use that are all-in-one, or am I going to have to buy multiple mics to get the best quality audio? I'm using Logic Pro X on my MacBook, which has worked decently for mixing. I think I just need to learn how to utilize the program better, but studio time is something I've looked into also. Right now I just don't think I have enough material to justify the investment. Working on that though.","15_1"

They're great for podcasting, video conferencing, really rough demos, and hobbyists, but not for any kind of decent music recording.  Literally any midrange condenser or decent dynamic mic would be better than that.

For those on a budget, I recommend the Behringer C1 (NOT the C1U...that's the USB version and it's terrible).  It's a surprisingly decent LDC for absolute dirt cheap.  Audio Technica also makes some decent midrange LDCs.  Keep in mind, though, that with condenser mics, you will need an audio interface that supplies phantom power.  I personally use the Focusrite Scarlette 2i2 (2nd gen) for small/solo projects; it's small and relatively inexpensive.

As far as dynamic mics (no phantom power needed) go, Shure makes a variety of decent midrange mics, including the tried and true SM57 and SM58, both of which I've used on everything from vocals to acoustics to electrics and even drums. 

Logic is a decent program, but has fallen by the wayside a bit as far as DAWs are concerned.","15_1_1"

Most songs are in one key which includes certain notes that sound good together. The classic Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do is one example of a series of notes that sound good in relation to each other based off their relative intervals in pitch. No matter which note you start with, the Do Re Mi intervals stay the same for each different key. 

Your music is playing in one key but your vocals often choose notes that are not in the same key. And even when you are in the correct key, you are not accurately hitting the pitch. Its either flat or sharp. 

Now some degree of being off pitch can be endearing, but not to the extend you are off pitch. 

How do you fix this? For some people it comes naturally. But for most others it requires lots of purposeful practice and a better understanding of musical theory. There are probably YouTube tutorials on vocal lessons that could probably be very helpful.","1_1_1_1_1"

You can always re record it later on down the line if youd like, which would be easier to do if you see the idea to completion. A partial idea left unattended is harder to get back into than one that has the full structure, even one thats barebones. Make a full sculpture, but one that you can warp and shape when/if better tools, and/or other musicians become available to assist furthering the original concept.

No matter what, keep it up!

Leme think about this and edit my comment when I have an answer

Edit 1: what a truly amazing song lmao

Edit 2: here are some songs to compliment it on a playlist:

Apollo St Paul and the Broken Bones

The System Dreams in Total Darkness The National

Lights Out, Words Gone Bombay Bicycle Club

Lover Boy Phum Viphurit

Color Me Lucky Jonathan Terrell 

Gold Rush Death Cab For Cutie

On The Regular Shamir

Hearts Beat Loud Keegan Dewitt

For the soundscape features or fast repetitive beats or tempo or vocal sound, I suggest these. 

And after reevaluating these, I think the last one might come closest. If you find anything else yourself, LET ME KNOW!","1"

Obvs ""Daft Punk is Playing at My House and ""Losing My Edge"" are probably their most famous songs. Personally I really like the ""43:33"" mix they released but that's much more electronic.

If you are into that, LCD Soundsystem are heavily influenced by 70s/80s band Talking Heads - you could try their 1980 album Remain In Light.

And here are some other big (or medium) Indie hits from around that time (early and mid-2000s) that I think have a bit of a similar vibe (though most of these don't have as much of a dance/electronic bent):

The Modern Age - The Strokes

Slow Hands / Evil - Interpol

My Coco - Stellastar

House of Jealous Lovers - The Rapture

Staring At The Sun - TV On The Radio

I Love The Valley Oh! - Xiu Xiu

Destruction loops seem to impart even more character and wear to what is already a lofi medium, so I'm curious to experiment further with recording length, tape scrunching, object sharpness, etc.

  
Happy to answer any questions regarding the approach to production here. Cheers!

The first song is way better than what I expected, the audio quality and the audio mix is great! The vocalist fits very well to the song and the emotions it wants the listener to feel.

The second one reminded me of My Chemical Romance (the very firsts songs). I don't know if you want to go the way they went (the alternative rock and punk vibes), but I think it's a good time for Eyes Half Shut to decide their own sound, because right now I don't feel there's something that makes me say ""Yeah, this sounds like Eyes Half Shut!"", Maybe it's very soon to decide this, but I think it would be okay to start thinking about that.

Anyways, I hope to listen more of you guys","8_1_1"

Unfortunately, having one song doesn't get enough people interested, and the people you DO get interested have no where to go.  So that's good that youve got more releases coming!

&amp;#x200B;

The best way to grow on a specific channel (soundcloud or youtube especially) is to make that the \*EXCLUSIVE\* streaming site for that release.  This means there's only one place for them to go to find it, and you can get a better look at your fan base without it being dispersed on so many streaming platforms.  

&amp;#x200B;

I did a version of this recently.  In september I released my ep, Bloom, and I made physical copies that had a bonus track.  This gave a little more motivation for people to buy at my ep release party not just to support me but to get that extra track!  It won't be released on streaming platforms until March.

Just feels like you are spamming every digital avenue constantly and not sure how much value it adds. And with so many independent musicians doing the same thing its difficult to get heard through the constant stream.

But I guess if you dont put your songs on the table then youll always be a bedroom musician!!

Good old fashioned gigs and physical versions of the songs will probably win every time over digital listeners, especially in the long run

For instance, I don't listen often to Drake or other similar artists, and for me, Hybrid Theory was the best album of Linkin Park and I see other 2 albums from them here, Meteora and New Divide.
Seeing albuns from Pink Floyd, Fun, Paul Walker, and even Billie Eillish is good surprise meaning your taste range is pretty good.

I feel like I could recommend albuns or songs in almost every style that you might enjoy. From the old rock, to the 90 gold punk age, to the new rock, some metal,  and recent edm.

A few names you might like, Young Guns, Disclosure, Flyleaf, The smashing Pumpkins, Vicetone, Offspring's Americana album, and I could name so much more.

Hope you give a listen. https://open.spotify.com/artist/27mm8EjK5vvk0vOuyi1y9o?si=ryxyGBHHSwez318ettR4yQ","32"

I decided to be a little more specific and so I came up with 4 of my favorite records that I think fit what youre looking for. These are records that all make me want to dance or at least bang my head. They are the exact type of records that if I put on in the car while I run errands on a sunday, they will make my whole day bright and get me excited to be productive and have a good day. If this is a bit much just check out the song Dont Dance Her Down by the Fiery Furnaces.

The Fiery Furnaces - Gallowsbirds Bark
-
A bit experimental at times, but in a cool interesting way, rather than a just get on with it way. The catchier dancier tunes REALLY hit though.
-(another) sampler song: Im Gonna Run

Liz Phair - Exile in Guyville
-
very down-to-earth. Good catchy tunes with very direct, story-like lyrics. Great vibes for when you want a good mood but something super cheery or dancey would be a bit much.
-sampler song: Never Said

New Pornographers - Electric Version
-
More on the other end of the spectrum from the Liz Phair record, this one is extremely cheery, dancey, uplifting, and fast-paced. Fantastic for when youre in a great mood and really want to lean into it, or when you just need something happy. The harmonizing between the two main vocalists (female and male) really make it pop.
-Sampler Song: From Blown Speakers

Aye Nako - Silver Haze
-
This ones slightly on the edgier side, it leans more punk and is more of a head-banger than a hip-mover. A super cathartic album that has gotten me out of ruts before. It can draw you in when youre sad/frustrated/upset, give you space to let all of that out, while at the same time uplifting you with some very pretty guitar melodies.
-Sampler song: Half Dome


Hope I sold you / anyone else on these. And congratulations on deciding to turn your outlook on life around! You made this post so youre clearly following through. I dont even know you and idk it just makes me so happy. Maybe you made me think of some people in my life who are doing the same. Best wishes &lt;3","47"

I got into these guys late last year and Invitation to Her's has EASILY been my most listened to album this semester. Something about their music is just so incredible. Almost feel like I got to know them and that they've been here with me getting me through this tough semester. Always watched live performances of theirs and loved watching Audun just get so into the music. As a broke Grad student who can't even spend a dime without keeping track of it, I bought the record without hesitation and was hoping they'd hit my city so I could eventually see them play, meet them and potentially get the album signed. This is just fucking tragic, so much talent and such incredible people. Rest in Peace this absolutely amazing duo and their tour manager.

|**name**|[**CHVRCHES**](http://radd.it/music/artist/chvrches)|  
|**about artist**|CHVRCHES (pronounced as &amp;quot;churches&amp;quot;) are a Scottish electronic band from Glasgow, formed in 2011. The group consists of Lauren Mayberry (lead vocals, occasionally synths and samplers), Iain Cook (synths, guitar, bass, vocals) and Martin Doherty (synths, samplers, vocals). The group's debut album, The Bones of What You Believe, was released on 20 September 2013.  Previously, Mayberry was a member of the bands Boyfriend/Girlfriend and Blue Sky Archives. Mayberry is a trained drummer and also did a four-year law degree, followed by a Masters in journalism. ([more on last.fm](http://www.last.fm/music/CHVRCHES))|  
|**album**|**AM**, released Sep 2013|  
|**track**|**Do I Wanna Know?**|  
|**about track**|The new song was first played live at a concert in May 2013 in Ventura, California, and was the opening number for both of their Scandinavian gigs at Hultsfred Festival in Sweden and again at the Danish NorthSide festival on June 14 and June 16 respectively.   The song Do I Wanna Know was released for download on iTunes on the morning of June 19. Despite a midweek release, the song entered the UK singles chart at number 11, making it the band's highest charting single since &amp;quot;Fluorescent Adolescent&amp;quot; in 2007.  In terms of both lyrical content and aesthetic style, &amp;quot;Do I Wanna Know?&amp;quot; picks up from where the band's 2012 single &amp;quot;R U Mine?&amp;quot; left off. The guitar riffs are strikingly similar, but the song is more downtempo. The track continues the hard-edged, rocking sound of their previous album Suck It and See. In concert, singer and guitarist Alex Turner uses a Vox 12 string electric guitar. The song is in G minor.|

This is the 4th time ive typed this out because the reddit app keeps freezing. Musics too good i guess. 

I find all my favorite small artists on r/IndieMusicFeedback. Thats my absolute favorite place for finding hidden gems. On top of listening to most of the stuff i see there, A person compiles the best artists of each month and adds them to playlists. I personally use spotify, so i have some of the more recent playlists saved.

|**about artist**|Death Cab for Cutie is an American indie rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Chris Walla (guitar, keyboards), Nicholas Harmer (bass), and Jason McGerr (drums).  Death Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band's vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour.

Mean thats just bad vibes honestly...this will cause him to lose a lot of respect and a lot of potential fans outside of the Reddit bubble because Lets be real Reddit is very much a boys club and doesnt have the best rep...he wont get the same kind of feedback/reception  he is getting here if he were to post this on YouTube or play this at a cafe etc and he will get these kinds of responses thats the reality if he continues to go through with producing this diss track, I wont be the only person with this reaction....Been in the music scene I know what Im talking about...the fact of the matter is the melody and vocals are VERY pretty but the Lyrics are ugly and they dont even match...I think it would be smarter for him to channel this and go a different route, maybe explore his feelings more maybe try a little obscurity.. and add some depth and maturity to what hes experiencing ...I mean he indirectly calls her a bitch, it just reads as immature and weak...that might get approval here but a lot of people wont see that as a clever line elsewhere and though a lot of artists do call women bitches, I stand by my statement its not cool. At the end of the day its an opinion homie, he can do what he wants but people do end up regretting diss tracks, they do end up biting people in the ass and I wont be the only person who vocalizes this.","3_1_1"

The pixies entire catalog from come on pilgrim to trompe le monde is epic. Surfer Rosa is of particular note. Literally some of the best music ever written in history; for a multitude of reasons. 

Wild nothings Gemini and Nocturne albums are both a must listen&nocturne being my personal favorite.
