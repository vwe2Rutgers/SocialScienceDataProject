You've got to be crazy and Raving and Drooling were the working titles, I believe.  Floyd is/was known for trying out material live before recording it, and there are a lot of things that never made it to a studio album, particularly from the pre-Dark Side period.","1"

It's typical to put a song together in the studio before taking it out on the road. Especially when people are coming to see you because they liked your record you don't want to be playing songs they've never heard before.

*Before* bands put out their first record, of course, is a whole different situation.

And then you have jam bands who play songs live before writing them (as it were), groups like Radiohead that like to perform things they're still working on or road test songs, and then far-out edge cases like Sisters of Mercy: They went on strike against their record label but kept writing new songs, and haven't been able to get signed since, so they just go around playing sets of *only* songs the audience has never heard before. (While covered in so much fog machine you can't see the band, because the singer got fat. You can only assume you're seeing Sisters of Mercy play because that's what it says on the ticket.)","29_3"

Its not a big hit or anything, but I saw Injury Reserve perform Oh Shit! months before it was released, and it created an energy I havent seen at many rap shows in the past twenty years.

People used to ask Zepplin what it was like the first time they played Stairway to Heaven. And they said something like it was kinda anticlimactic, no one knew the song. I think thats indicative. Even when an established band is touring just as they release a new album, the crowd is often a lot more dead on the new stuff because far few people know the song. While the stuff from older albums everyone knows and dances and sings along to.

That said for smaller acts with more of a cult following, words and recordings do tend to get around. I saw Frank Turner play Four Simple Words at 2-3 shows before it was released on an album (he had been playing it for well over a year before the album came out). 

I saw Beck perform Nobodys Fault But My Own before Mutations came out.

I saw Thurston Moore in a small venue in New England years back and he started the set saying I was driving out here and wasnt sure what I was going to play tonight, so I think Im just gonna try out some songs on you that Kim (Gordon) and I have been working on for our next album that album ended up being the last Sonic Youth album before their broke up.

I saw an act called Mutual Admiration Society which was the members of Nickel Creek, Glenn Philips of Toad the Wet Sprocket, John Paul Jones of Led Zepplin, and Pete Thompson of Elvis Costellos Attractions/Imposters. They only had one album they did together so they did some covers and some songs that they were writing on the bus on tour, some of those songs ended up on individual members next albums.","44"

""Can't Stop"" debuted live in 2006 and did not make an album until 2018, lol. They road test their songs before putting them on an album quite often.  This even includes some of their most popular songs.  For instance, recently circulated footage shows ""Crash Into Me"" having debuted live (in not so final form) in 1995, about 8 months before the album ""Crash"" was actually released.  In the same footage, Dave plays ""Raven"" which did not make an album until 5 years later.

It was played live once I believe for a small audience of people and wasn't recorded. It was eventually released in 2010 on Pinkerton Deluxe.

Weezer also went through a period where they played as ""Homie"" with some other revolving musicians during their hiatus, and they played a ton of songs live then that were only released later on Rivers' solo albums, or some were reworked for future albums (including one that just released this year), or never officially released at all.","52"
