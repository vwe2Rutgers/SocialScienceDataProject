Its hard to beat Justin Townes Earles first few albums, but my fave is *Midnight at the Movies,* though *Harlem River Blues* is also exceptionally good. Other JTE records you might dig include his first EP, *Yuma,* and the album that came out after *Harlem River Blues* called *Nothings Gonna Change The Way You Feel About Me Now.*

If you like Steve Earle, then you should go listen to his first two albums, *Guitar Town* and *Copperhead Road.* Thats where he earned his reputation as one of his generations best songwriters. 

Classic albums of the genre include Willie Nelsons *Red Headed Stranger,* Waylon Jennings *Honky Tonk Heroes,* and Dwight Yoakams *Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.*","1"

Another personal favorite of mine is Ashley McBryde. Shes an incredibly talented singer and songwriter who is definitely country in every sense of the word, but also has a rock edge to her that I really love. Her two albums, Girl Going Nowhere and Never Will are both great.

It stirred my curiosity so I took a few minutes of my time to search the web of it.  If I'm understanding it correctly, that would be a keeper!   Thanks for sharing it.    :)


Written by Kristoffer Kristofferson

I found this comment regarding the song in one of the websites and I'm wonder if it is correct. ---------------------------&gt;&gt;&gt;  "" Yeah - on my version, before he starts the song, he has a little introduction
- 'Couple of years back, I came across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio, and while he was reciting some poetry to me that he'd written, I saw he was about a step away from dying, and I couldn't help and wonder why. And the lines of this song occured to me. I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted and he's got him a good woman. I'd like to dedicate this to John and June [Cash] who helped show me how to beat the devil...' ""

For my money, there's not much better than Waylon singing a Kristofferson song, I highly recommend checking out Waylon's album The Taker/Tulsa, which notably has 4 KK songs, a Shel Silverstein song and a Don Gibson song. It's an early Waylon killer!","3_1"

https://youtu.be/vwuoFt0c1VM

I listened to the Waylon full album The Taker/Tulsa via Youtube while having my dinner. This is the first time I ever listened to a Waylon Jennings album. I enjoy both Waylon and Kris's vocals very much. I'm not really sure why Waylon and some of the others are not on my radar today (in my memories, from childhood) because they sound so good that I would think that I would have remembered some of those songs. Maybe their songs were played at a time where I had been listening to other genres of music ( I went through A LOT different genres at different time periods in my life ) (???). I sure remember Johnny Cash though! As a child I remember wanting really really really really bad to go see Johnny Cash in concert. I really don't understand why I don't recall some of the others unless I had already started listening to other genres(????).

As for July unless it's close to a strawberry wine reference I can't imagine it's related to that specific song. I'd need examples.

My guess is lots of songs are about being young, and July comes over the middle summer break.  June still has school for some/most of the month (atleast where I came from), and August dosent really flow or rhyme like July.  July also has independence day so there are lots of BBQs and fairs.

The genre is so diverse its almost impossible to define with a single playlist.","8_1"

There's always something to explore.

Some of the more notable subgenres (by no means a complete list) include bluegrass, Western swing, rockabilly, western, country rock, outlaw country, alt country/Americana, Bakersfield sound, Nashville sound, etc.

There are also earlier styles that influenced the direction country music would take. The folk music of Scotland and Ireland and the folk music that evolved into in Appalachia and the American south, cowboy ballads, early blues styles, Cajun music, southern gospel... All of that played a role in what country music became, as did gypsy jazz and rock and roll from the 1950s onward.

I'm by no means an expert on most of these subgenres, but I've spent years listening. If any of them sound particularly interesting to you, I could probably help you out with some of the biggest names involved throughout their history and maybe some of those trying to keep those subgenres alive today.","8_2_1"

And the vibe this guy has is just undeniable, listening to ""You're so good when you're bad"" right now. As far as my fav country artist of the last 10 years first off I gotta mention  Jason Isbell. I remember sometime in 2012 I decided to listen to ""Southeastern"", was just randomly in a country mood that night. I went on a vacation that week and I sat there and listened to the album and it made me tear up every fuckin night. In a good way. I don't think an albums hit me like that since then.

As far as more of a traditional country sound I really like Jamey Johnson. ""The guitar song"" is probably his best project, the one before that(has ""in color"" on it) has the bigger hits so either ones a good starting point.","8"

Dont go by the Bob Harris show on Radio 2 as he mainly focuses on UK Country/Folk bands which are mostly girl groups with tight harmonies. Very pretty but not much substance. 
In the UK there is the Shires who again are more Country Folk but there are also up and comers such as Elles Bailey, Kezia Gill, Peter Donegan (www.peterdonegan.com) Two Ways Home. 
My advice for the UK and keeping in touch with best Country Music from both sides of the pond are these two radio stations:
ARC Radio and Express FMs country show with Russell Hill. 
I hope that helps. =

If Kendrick Lamar one day started heavily featuring banjos and fiddle, I wouldn't consider rap music to have 'evolved' to the point of banjo and fiddle usage. It would clearly be an artist doing a take on predetermined sounds.

There are plenty of truthfull, heartfelt stories to be told in the classic style, and I don't think they require anything sonically groundbreaking to be appreciated. 

Take Kacey Musgraves' Merry Go Round (Contrast that with Musgraves' most recent, decidedly pop-influnced album with lots of ""new"" sounds. It genuinely seems like the presence of the pop production limited the ability of heartfelt lyrics to be written), or Heading South by Zach Bryan. They both sound modern and inspiring in their quality, while not offering anything truly different from comparable releases of the last 60 or so years.

At the same time, there's now Newgrass and Americana, clear linear progressions from earlier C&amp;W sounds, yet offering wildly inventive and new playing styles. And while not played on top 40 radio, they consistently are ranked to be the most genuine modern country releases.

There needs to be better national representation for these ambitious styles. Something other than Nashville. Something outside the bounds of the confines of the Grand Ol Opry, and the largely corrupt boardmembers that run the money machine these days. The 'genuine country listening community' also encompasses plenty of fans that have simply became complacent and don't seem to care. Or perhaps they don't hear or aren't bothered by the garish changes in style. I'm not sure.

Whatever it is, the fans of that ""true"" sound, need to come together and make it known. After covid finally blows over, we need venues that are willing to pay to put these people out. Independent, I suppose internet, radio stations to play these folks. Money needs to be spent on them, their shows, most importantly their albums. The thing that needs to be accepted I guess, is that we as a community need to work harder in our efforts to support people making music that matters.","1"

It's Billy Ray Cyrus putting on a performance I would have legitimately never expected from him.

Gut wrenching lyrics with beautiful, straightforward instrumentation, and then bam: King Phazer does his verse and it was the first time I felt like rap and country had successfully blended since Cowboy Troy's verse on Big &amp; Rich's Rollin' (which others may or may not agree with).

It felt sincere in a way I don't hear in top 40 rap features on country songs. I remember a Jason Aldean remix with lyrics rapped ""Yeah... Lemonade! slip 'n' slides!"" And I genuinely don't know if they could have penned a more embarrassing line.

The big names from the 70s all fit drugged out or just split and quit throughout the late 80s, and the genre dissolved. The new guys didn't sound like the old bands anymore, and all of the fans subdivided and migrated to sub-genres like Punk and Metal, and the radio stations all either switched to ""pop"" or started playing the same old songs as ""classic rock."" This was also when Country had it's big revival in polarity in the late 80s-early 90s, which is no coincidence.

Now look at the current state of Country. The good old artists have all retired or just stopped being played on the radio, the new stuff doesn't sound much like the old stuff at all, and the fans are starting to subdivide into sub-genres like red dirt and Americana...

History repeats itself, and I predict we won't be hearing new music that sounds like country anymore before long, and we're practically there already. Using the Rock roadmap, we'll see country radio have to make a switch to some other genres to stay alive, or they'll keep beating this pop country dead horse into their collective graves. 

I hope I'm wrong, though. Country is allowed to change its sound, and it's been doing that for years. Shania Twain sounded almost nothing like Loretta Lynn, but both of them deserve a spot in the Country Music hall of Fame. I'm not so sure about Kelsi Ballerini, though...

We're in a really strange place for music as a whole right now, and Country has the misfortune of hitting a transitional stage right at the same time. On the one hand, record labels are raking in money like it's no tomorrow with music that seemingly nobody likes. On the other hand, independent artists like Cody Johnson can sell out the Houston rodeo to 75k fans, but then be told he's [""Too rodeo for radio""](https://youtu.be/mVYZZ64-oD0) by country execs. On the (third?) hand, if you release a single without an accompanying choreographed TikTok dance, you might as well not even bother...

I don't know where we go from here, but one thing seems clear. Any time one genre tries to sound like another genre, it doesn't end well. You can sound different from old country without sounding like current hip-hop or pop. I just hope that figure that out.","6"

I got sober in 2015. Early on a lot of the music I loved, I was still too emotionally raw coming out of addiction. With time, I healed and was able to enjoy the stuff I felt disheartened by early on. With even more time it became a touchstone to remember what it was like before I got sober. Life keeps getting better as long as you keep moving forward. If theres ever anything I can do to help, please dont hesitate to drop a pm. Hope all is well, and congratulations on your new found sobriety!!","2"

Man this was some really cool music and I could definitely picture myself sitting by a campfire listening to this, I think it's perfect for that. I always felt like country music often gets a lot of unnecessary hate and judgement but I have found it really fun. I obviously have heard country before although I'm not an avid listener but I did like it. It was very simple, there was no fluff or anything, just straight up a man and his guitar and some harmonica here and there. On Wikipedia I see there are a bunch of other instruments listed but to be honest they weren't that prominent, the music was very focused. My favourite song was Black Rose. It comes together nicely. It was a more energetic song which I usually prefer but there's plenty of variety on this album. I also liked Low Down Freedom a lot. Another faster song with an explosive chorus that I liked. This is a good time to mention that I really enjoyed the vocals. The deeper sound his voice had sounded fantastic and it suited the album's style well. Omaha and Ain't No God in Mexico were fun songs too. My least favourite song was Ride Me Down Easy which is... lol can this song get any slower? I feel like if they made it just a bit slower my heart rate would stop lmao. It's perfect for putting children to sleep tho. Okay jokes aside it was an alright song but didn't do much for me. I don't hate ballads, in fact, Old Five and Dimers (Like Me) was a well made one but I just wasn't into this song that much. A criticism I can bring up for the album as a whole is that it's pretty short, only 27 minutes. I wouldn't have minded if it were longer but I guess less work for me lol. Some of the songs were a little short too, I would've liked to listen to some of them longer, but I feel like if that is the only criticism I can bring up that's a good thing. Overall I really enjoyed this album.

Songs I particularly liked: Old Five and Dimers (Like Me), Low Down Freedom, Omaha, Ain't No God in Mexico, Black Rose

Songs I wasn't crazy about: Ride Me Down Easy

I just want to quickly mention that I've created a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6UeVmURYhWyOVcT6yawRM3?si=664ec6d902dd4ac5) for this project, where I've added all of the albums I've so far listened to. Keep in mind that it's not a complete list, because not all of the albums were on Spotify, but most are there, so feel free to follow it if you want.","11"

They kind of softened my pallet up for country that was a little ""harder"" -- outlaw country and more classical artists.

So if you're a rock and/or fan I'd check out Southern Rock first to get a taste for southern sounds, and if you like it then move on to ""harder"" country like Hank Williams Jr, Jerry Reed, David Allen Coe, Charlie Daniels, Alabama, Johnny Paycheck, and others.

Maybe they felt it would be more impactful when making a video if they treated it as a death, so that's the direction they went for the video. I feel similarly about ""What hurts the most"" by Rascal Flatts and ""I still miss you"" by Keith Anderson. I got breakup vibes when hearing the songs but they made the videos about death. After re-reading those songs' lyrics though, it's 50/50 of death or breakup. But I think ""Tell me I was dreaming"" is about a breakup. 

One last thought though, I've seen some argue that once an artist releases a work (song/painting/poem/etc.), that it's totally up to the recipient as to the meaning. Sure, the artist can say ""here's what I meant when I made it,"" but ultimately it's up to whoever is listening to the song to decide what it means to them. So if you think it's a breakup song, then it's a breakup song. If someone else thinks it's a death song, then it's a death song.","5"

Willie has a lifetime lock on my top spot.  In my opinion nobody is/was the whole package quite like Willie Nelson.  He's as good as it gets as a singer, songwriter AND guitar player, all wrapped up in this cosmic wandering gypsy package.

I know it's weird that I landed on a song he didn't write, but ""Blue Eyes"" happens to be my favorite song on my favorite album (Red Headed Stranger) by my favorite artist.

Instrumentation plays a role, but isn't enough to make something a country song by itself. For example, though a fiddle/violin is big in country music, [Bach's Partita No.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSAMK3kiz5c) wouldn't qualify as a country song.

Lyrics are important, but not necessary; mainly because there are some great [instrumental country songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2Hboae0eOs) that don't have lyrics whatsoever.

Who the singer is doesn't play a role in the slightest. Just because someone records a song with someone known as a country singer doesn't automatically make the new song country. For example, [here's Waylon Jennings singing White Room.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHpy3UWLCO8) Just because he's one of the greatest country singers of all time doesn't make the cover country.

The primary difference is who is control of music. Real country controlled by songwriters and musicians. Nashville is controlled by producers and executives.

A real country song is either written by a single person, band, or something that's been passed down. A common result might be an album that includes songs written by the artist plus a cover or two. The same 5-6 players are on every song with maybe 1-2 guests for a song or 2.

I don't like those extensions of country, and I don't listen to them. My favorite Pandora station is one I made based on George Jones.

That being said, I've heard people say what isn't country and when asked what is, it's usually the stuff that was current when they started listening and/or what their parents listened to. 

The thing about country is it has been a popular form of music for so long, that each generation has to put their own spin on it to stay interesting. Just look back through the decades and the different styles that were infused. You go from Hank with an almost crude twangy sound, then you get some rockabilly, some overly-produced lush string accompanied classic pop country, then neo-traditional of the 80s, then some Garth Brooks rock n roll stylings, it's all over the place.

So when I hear someone say ""that's not country"", I am skeptical. Sure there are defining elements like lyrical content being more in regards to common people life and relationships, and instrumentation that is typical of country, but I think you can't put too fine of a point on how those are implemented for the sake of the genre's need for evolution.

So while country rap sucks in our opinion, it's somebody's country. Kind of like that perverted cousin that nobody likes but hey, they're family lol.","14_1"

They weren't interested in traditional Native American music, they wanted to hear what people played when they partied. And they recorded it and put out a record. From the liner notes is obvious that there is a generational split. The older musicians would play Scottish fiddle tunes (sung in French) and the younger ones would play country. The generational difference in music taste is inherent in the nature of commercial radio.","14_1_1"

Acoustic guitars, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, and light percussion are all common and somewhat necessary elements. Not all of these things have to be present 100% of the time, but some combination is important.  

The singers voice also plays a factor. Twang. 

Lyrical content is important. Story telling, and simply themes and words associated with country/western/southern life or associated with country music as we know it. 

I think these are the 3 main factors for something to be ""country"". You can mix and match with some of the elements present and some missing and I'm sure sometimes you'll still end up with a product that most would consider ""country"", and you could probably even include most the elements and find something that isn't really country (although that might be tough) since nuance is important and small changes can have big impacts. But still, I think that is a really fair summary and requirements.","17"

shit, orry- just realized you said old country. One of the darkest old ones I know is Wynn Stewart singing One Way To Go (it's s suicide song I believe). IT's been wiped off the internet for some rights reason (it's on Spotify but greyed out and it's been removed from Youtube). See if you can find that somehow.

to a lonely room where nobody cares

also Faron Young had some dark stuff in the later part of his career. Both he and WYnn were so great at the emotion behind these songs.  It's the kind of thing that Johnny Cash did at the end of his career- super dark delivery.","8"

I'm in my early 40s.  So traditional to me goes back to Ernest Tubb and Bob Wills, both core sounds that started in the '40s and remained more or less intact and prevalent into the early 90s.  After that Bon Jovi seemed to become the core ""country"" sound.  And post 2015 or so, the trap drums and overall production style, as well as chord changes, are pretty much pure pop, but with extremely overdone and straining southern accents in the vocals in the (reasonable) event that you forgot you were listening to a ""country"" song.  IMO country music, aside from legacy and fringe artists - some of whom are excellent but still on the fringe - has been dead for 25 years.  I think the internet killed it.  It's hard to have local scenes when everything can be everywhere all the time.  And now we have global monogenre.  yay.","6_1_1_1"

Brooks &amp; Dunn is a country duo that early on was sometimes considered rock. Their first two albums are some of my favorite.

Eric Church ""The Outsiders"" is a metal song. Also the whole album ""Chief"" has some rock elements and is very fun.

A lot of Jason Aldean's stuff has solid to great guitar work. ""She's Country"" and ""The Only Way I Know"" are probably the best two examples but basically any up tempo song he has done. And I would put Justin Moore in a similar category. He did a cover of ""Home Sweet Home"" by Mtley Cre that is very good and Vince Neil sings with him. So listen to that if they are on your radar at all.

There are a lot 90's neotraditional artists that share characteristics with 80's hair metal since mainstream was shifting at the time. Travis Tritt might be good try. I would start with ""T-R-O-U-B-L-E"" or ""Put Some Drive In Your Country"", Tracy Lawrence is great too ""If The Good Die Young"" is one of my favorite up tempo songs of his.","30"

Believe it or not, some people actually can grow up not realizing something is as bad as it is. 

I went to a diverse school (predominantly black). I heard the N word from all different races, every single day. They all said it just like someone would say ""bro"" or ""man"" or whatever. That was 15 years ago now. It seemed ""normalized"" at that point. I didn't say it as it didn't seem right for me to, but plenty of white, mexican and asian kids used it all the time in a ""non-negative"" light along with the black kids.

It's such a weird word to me now. It's so taboo for white people to even spell it out when explaining something, but it gets thrown around constantly by minorities as a term of endearment.

I think both groups are misguided. 

Im glad he apologized and seems to be using this as a learning opportunity. Im also glad hes telling people to not defend him. I think what he said is terrible. I dont approve of it and Ill never defend it. But Ill still listen to his music, especially after that apology. 

The people defending him saying the N word and saying its just a word why is he being canceled?! or the people that specifically went out and bought his album because he said it are the problem. So you didnt want his album until he said the N word? Thats fucking racist. Also, its not just a word. I remember thinking that when I was an immature high school student who thought words were just words and didnt have meaning. Turns out I grew up, maybe its their turn. 

Heres to hoping this leads to Morgan changing his life for the better. Keep the same energy, keep making the great music (my opinion), and try to cut out the distractions aka excessive alcohol use and partying.

I asked why the hate and sudden change of heart and he said that he never actually took the time to listen to the words and the emotion behind most of the songs. Newer pop music is almost benign and has a beat that you can bop your head to. He said also it was a mob mentality, it was cool to not like country music and listening to it took him out of his comfort zone of mindless entertainment. Now he's borderline annoying sending me YouTube videos of classic country singers that he's recently discovered and I've been listening to for 30 years.

And there's nothing wrong with that. Depression is a very real affliction for people, and people who are depressed want to listen to stories that they relate to. There's not really a market for sad Pop or sad Rock (except maybe nu-metal and emo). If the study had been done 100 years ago the answer would have been the blues. Nowadays, the answer may actually be mumble rap, as I don't see depressed people relating to bro or pop country, neither has any emotional weight.

Most people don't like thinking about their own sadness. A lot of people who say they hate country music, really just hate music that makes them examine that sadness.

As for the political association, the trump campaign is viewed as being kinda white trash. The term may be offensive to people, but everybody knows what it is, and everybody knows what it looks like. Florida-Georgia Line, Blake Shelton, Toby Keith, etc, could also be described as white trash, and they've unfortunately dominated the genre for two decades. Note, *being* country isn't what makes someone trashy. It's all based around fake imagery, and as long as there are two groups doing a similar type of cringy thing, there's going to be a correlation.

The type of person who beats their wife, usually fancies themselves a bit of a good ol boy, or a real man at the least. The reality is, most good ol boys weren't, and aren't, that great to their wives.

Most people don't hate 'country', but the attitude around a bro country personality. In the same way most country listeners don't hate rap, but dislike the attitude and subject matter of most top 40 rappers","6"

Much of that can be said much more of a few other music genres. That's just messed up thinking to be calling country music out above many others.

Either you can live your life and enjoy it or you can worry about what everybody else thinks and does and does not like or enjoy and you can go through all your life living your life for them. No thank you!

Myself personally, for the last 20-plus years my favorite genre is contemporary Christian and southern gospel and classical but I still love listening to other genres here and there though. The the last few many years lately I've not really listened to much music at all except for this here online or the occasional every once in awhile radio......  

I enjoy some country music but I also enjoy many other genres. There's some songs I listen to in each music genre and there's some songs that I do not ( do not care to ) listen to each music genre.

I enjoy the nostalgic country music songs as well as maybe just a few of the more recent ones. I do remember as a child though there were some country songs that were of cheating and drinking and.... I really didn't like but there were some really awesome good country Tunes that we're very positive and that I enjoyed very much as a child and still enjoy today. I could also say that same thing regarding many many many others music genres that I enjoy very much.

There was a point in my life where I really enjoyed Rock the most for many years. A lot of that was not positive . A lot of that could speak to the OP comments... once in awhile I look at that again hoping to find something Rocking with really good lyrics. Hahaha I keep trying, every once in awhile.

Sorry about the rambling....

The first two paragraphs here - That!  Personally, that's it for me.

My parents listened to the oldies station, my sister's listened to 80s music. I listened both those growing up and I still enjoy those songs. I listen to rock, alternative, and grunge now. I made my own Pandora station that includes all of those genres, plus animated Disney movie songs cause I like a lot of music. I can't do the modern rap, but some older rap is ok. And I can't do country. I'm from the Chicago area, and surprisingly there are 2 rock stations, 1 is brand new and changed over to rock from a country station. And 1 only plays older rock songs from between the 70s and 90s, so I don't listen to it much. Most stations are country or rap. 
I don't like modern country cause it's that new age country/pop. I've heard it, it may as well be southern rap. And I've heard the older country as well and it just sounds whiney. Singing about their beer, their wife left them, their pick up truck, and their dogs. Most of the lyrics are sad, and depressing whining about their life. I know there are some upbeat ones. Those are usually about hanging with their boys drinking beer and whiskey. And they all have that southern accent or ""twang"". And even people who don't speak in a southern accent will fake one to make their country songs sound more to the genre. The ""twang"" makes all the music sound more whiney and yodle like to me. That is why I don't like country music.","13"

When i say ""I dont like country"" i dont mean all of it, i can appreciate the talents and skills some country artists have (brad paisely fucking rips on guitar but people only know him for singing, or marty roe from diamond rio is one of my top 5 male vocalists)

What i dont like is effortless/formulaic/cookie cutter/radio friendly stuff, and that means all music, there are some rock/metal bands that i cant stand (asking alexandria, attack attack, nirvana, etc) 

There are some country songs i have downloaded and actually listen to (less than 10 but still some)

Heres the list of country songs i like

""Unbelievable"" by diamond rio
""I beleive"" by diamond rio
""Bubba hyde"" diamond rio
""If bubba can dance"" shenandoah
""3rd rock from the sun"" joe diffie
""Queen of memphis"" confederate railroad
""Trashy women"" confederate railroad
""T.r.o.u.b.l.e."" travis Trott
""Hillbilly rock"" marty stuart (one of the only country singers that doesnt either have or fake an accent)
EDIT: I almost forgot to add dwight yoakams cover of ""crazy little thing called love""

Hell that reminds me, avenged sevenfold made a country song (literally just a country song without the accent)

[""dear god"" by avenged sevenfold](https://youtu.be/mzX0rhF8buo)

On the dear god song, the instrument that sounds like a lap steel is actually a telecaster and a blues slide finger thing

Oh wait that also reminds me trivium did a joke country song because they recorded their album ""shogun"" in memphis

[""my dog my truck my woman"" by trivium](https://youtu.be/nL51e57tfrY)

EDIT: im adding this now cause i just thought of it, but there are a lot of country ""artists"" that dont write any of their stuff, they use a ghost writer, same problem with pop (I dont include rap because i know a lot of them write the lyrics themselves even if they need someone else to make the beats)

Also to give you all a look at what my taste in music is, these are my top 3 songs of all time

[""into the mouth of hell we march"" by trivium](https://youtu.be/aKdMrEpgmy4)

[""be one"" by killswitch engage](https://youtu.be/TPhVyIOjZYQ)

Country is probably the most diverse genre umbrella outside of pop. You have bro country, hip hop country, pop country, red dirt country, folk, and a ton of other massive subgenres crammed together as ""country ""

Likewise you have Toby Keith 'boot up your ass' songs intermixed with anti-trump or whatever else. 

Country has never been more diverse than it is now, with some many small and independent artists putting out an incredible depth of music.

Like /u/xnodesirex said, country is now very diverse as its become a major cash cow by co-opting pop music. but what they don't really mention is country was at one point a very tight-knit good old boy's club whose exclusiveness was rivaled probably only by punk rock (think ""posers"".)  This is even highlighted this past year with the lack of a tribute to John Prine at the CMAs-- he was never considered true country by the Nashville elite. [Here's an article](https://theboot.com/george-jones-carrie-underwood-taylor-swift/) about George Jones (rip) claiming newer country stars like Taylor Swift (at the time was country) and Carrie underwood ""stole their \[old school country musician's\] identity"".

At one point, country or ""hillbilly music"" catered to exclusively rural audiences, which tended to vote democrat and a little more leftist (the proverbial yellow dog democrats). Rural people shifted right and the left shifted wayyy left in the 60s, but country was kind of a unifying force with folks like Cash and Willie and Hag. With the Reagan years, you saw a lot of songs praising the working man, which kind of played into the Repiblican narrative. Then came 9/11. Suddenly we were putting boots up people's asses and saying goodbye to traveling soldiers and remembering where we were when the world stopped turning, and getting letters from home. Which was great. Country music really helped people process that dark time. But somehow, we started conflating being proud of your country with a particular party. And we never stopped.","6"

The genre is much deeper than I realized, though. The pop stuff is mostly trash, but that's true for every genre. Like when people say they flat out don't like rap I wonder if they've heard Mos Def or ATCQ. Now with country I'm trying to turn friends on to Sturgill and Childers. This week I found out about Nick Shoulders and Colter Wall and holy shit it's amazing stuff.

People generally associate those who listen to country with being undereducated, rural and blue collar folks, and it's pretty much politically correct to hate on these people even though most of them, as in, 99.9% of them never hurt a living soul in their entire life.

There's also this fact that tons of country music are genuinely bad. I'm not gonna name any names but let's just say his first name begins with L and last name B.

I'm a foreigner, Asian, and that's not exactly a turn off for me, if anything I think I can appreciate the humor of it. If you listen to country music chances are you like America enough to not be bothered by these things, besides it's wrong to say ""it's not the only perspective"", because how would you even have this idea that it's even a huge part of country music's perspective? The dominant perspectives of country are 1. simple love, 2. homesickness and 3.important lessons in life. Respectively, the most outstanding works that fall into those categories are: 1.Donna Fargo's happiest girl in the whole U.S.A, Ballad of a Teenage Queen, Love at Five and a Dime; 2. Back to the Well, Country Road, Detroit; 3. May the Birds of Paradise Fly Upon Your Nose, The Gambler.

And you don't have to feel bad for not liking country, a lot of Red State Christian types like my Ex hated it with a passion.","1_1"

&gt; To get more people into Country Music we need ~~more diversity~~ to be more accepting in the genre.

We need diversity by acceptance. I don't want people to ""get into country"" because they are minority, rather let's not shun people because they aren't straight white males. The early 2000's were a great time of males and female artists now, it seems it's mostly male dominate with an upswing of females. 

And for everyone that says, ""It's not country it's pop"" that is the wrong idea. Like I get that it's not CLASSIC country but country has always been an umbrella term like ""rock"" (Ben Folds Five and Metallica are both ""rock"" one is alt rock, and one is hard rock).","2_2"

If you really think a vaccine, and even vaccine mandates by companies, is ANYWHERE close to fascism than you need to retake a history class. 

Vaccines are not political, they have consistently been found to be safe and effective means of preventing and in come cases eradicating diseases. Like I asked before, ever gotten smallpox or polio? No, because its eradicated in the US- and smallpox globally and polio is close to full eradication. Ever get measles, mumps or rubella? Probably not because of the MMR vaccine. Whooping cough? I could go gone.

Vaccine mandates, especially in school, have ALWAYS been around. You needed them to go to public school (elementary through college), you needed them to play sports, to go to camp, etc.","3_1_1_2_1_1_1"

Im also a bit concerned that you are naive enough to think that politicians care about their constituents. Btw, it is the politicians that are destroying the economy and peoples livelihoods, not the virus.

So you dont think that governments forcing companies to discriminate against certain employees if they dont consume a product from another private company isnt just a little bit fascist? You dont think that governments instituting apartheid systems that force businesses to discriminate against certain customers isnt just a little bit fascist? If your argument is that the political elite should trample on civil liberties for the greater good then I think you might want to brush up on a little history yourself because that has been a go to line for brutal tyrants.

So no vaccine has ever been political and they are all safe and effective at eliminating diseases? Even the H1N1 vaccine of 1976 that was rushed out during an election year by the Ford administration? Ummm, ok...

If the vaccine isnt political then why is there so much pushback against promising treatments in order to keep the EUA for the vaccines? Why are vaccines the only option? Why is there so much censorship around dissenting opinions? Why did so many politicians and political voices pull a complete 180 on the vaccines once there was a shift in political power?

Comparing this vaccine to other vaccines is a terrible argument. Does smallpox and polio have an IFR on par with the flu the way covid does? Were those vaccines rushed through development within six months or did it take them years? Does their effectiveness wear off after 5 months? Does the limited amount of protection they provide cause small mutations which lead to vaccine evading variants?","3_1_1_2_1_1_1_1"

While his style of music is not very popular these days his legacy absolutely lives on through his major influences in the Opry and the record industry.  He founded Acuff-Rose song publishing house and was a major proponent for country music as wholesome entertainment for the family.  I believe Roy Acuff even fired Hank Williams from the Opry for his drinking.

Williams cut a phenomenal set of records, but his tenure of just a few years does not compare well to Roy Acuff's half-century career.","2_2"

And while I do love honky tonk Williams has never fit in with that well, I don't think.  I see him as a hillbilly singer, which is how he saw himself.  Some of my favorite songs from him are his gospel numbers and the sometimes goofy hillbilly songs (such as ""Dear John"" and ""Settin' the Woods on Fire"").  Everyone seems to love his heartbroke songs, but he had much more than just that to offer.

In a way, I think I look at him as one of the last hillbilly artists as his repertoire is very folkie.  He did more than sad songs and Acuff and nearly every other prior great country artist knew their way around sad songs as well.  I would never argue that Williams is not influential (that would be crazy).  Obviously he was that rare original artist whose work changed the industry.  And to add to your point Acuff and the other older artist's sad songs were more sentimental than the ""tear in my beer"" type stuff Hank was doing.  I think his biggest influence is in outlaw and underground country though, in that regard.  Hank would put out a lot of emotion in his singing and it feels as if his lyrics were more explicit and country has often propped up talk-singers and popular records are considerably less harder hitting than some of the stuff Williams did.

Apologies for the wall of text, I am rambling away.

TL;DR: I do agree that Hank Williams is a great artist, though for perhaps reasons different to yours.","2_2_1_1"

He did have that nice deep voice that he used well, but singing wasn't his marquee skill. Neither was his playing or his writting. His habit of arranging songs to two-verses, repaeat one of them, shift the key up a fourth, repeat the verse again, done isn't particularly clever.

His skill (very much like June Carter) was that he connected with the audience. He was a performer, an entertainer. And he entertained a whole lot. That typical arrangement that I mentioned, the audience loves it, no matter what musicians think. One doesn't need to be a good vocalist to tell a compelling story and have the audience enjoy hearing you sing those stories.","6_2_1_1"

1. He is clean cut and traditional, so he appeals to a wide group of people (from young fans to great grandparents). There is no controversy about GS-he has been married to the same woman for close to 50 years, with no allegations of cheating or ill-doing otherwise. 
2. He has a predictable sound-pretty much every album will have a balanced combination of upbeat music, Western swing, and ballads. 
3. He sounds pretty much the same live as he does on record. There is nothing worse than attending a show and the performer sounds nothing like they do on recorded media. His voice is smooth and he focuses on singing well and equally around the 4-sided stage-not dancing, showing off or running around. Ive seen him 5 times (from 1988 to 2020) and he was excellent every single time.
4. He is gracious and kind to others. He  is known for recognizing the people who he was inspired by (especially George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Bob Wills, but also Frank Sinatra and others. ) I am quite sure he keeps his mouth shut a great deal of the time and saves his personal beliefs about many things for private talk. It is pretty obvious he is conservative but doesnt paint his beliefs all over. He understands  the importance of a having a private life.

I do not believe he is the most talented person in country music or necessarily an innovator, but he has a rare combination of long term success,
universal appeal (as well as being a decent human) and and just plain old cowboy cool.","15"

That is how I feel about Luke Bryan's music. Is it deep? No. Does it talk about real issues? Not really (couple of his older songs are more serious). Does it sound good? Yeah, I think so. It's fun.

Roger Miller and Tom T. Hall are two of the best songwriters in the genre's history and some of their best known work is novelty songs.

Nor does all pop country have to be devoid of depth and artistic integrity. There were great pop country songs that were played back to back with Merle and Waylon.

The issue is that ALL mainstream country these days seems to be set in some fantasy universe where you drive your truck to a field every night to have a big party, consume massive amounts of alcohol, then wake up and do it all again. Nobody has a job to pay for any of it. Nobody ever develops a drinking problem or even gets a hangover. None of the girls they screw in the bed of their truck every night ever gets pregnant. The cops never show up. And alcohol and the occasional joint are as hardcore as it gets (as if there isn't an opiod epidemic currently ravaging rural America). 

The fact that nothing on the country station sounds like country musically is a problem, but the bigger loss is the lyrics. Country was always music for adults and offered songs about the real world. The real world can be fun sometimes, but sometimes it isn't.","12_1_1"

Chris Stapleton has been rocking legit songs for a good while now with a bit of an edgier side. Eric Church just played Stick that in your country song along with so many other awesome songs critiquing politics, reflecting on being a dad, an ode to his fans, etc... Maddie and Tae sang a song about alcoholism that did well on the charts. Ashley McBride brought back a murder ballad and has done some other great stuff. Even some of the poppy stuff like I Hope by Gabby Barrett is a pretty reflective song about being cheated on. And you have the Indy Scene that is still getting a lot of love (see Tyler Childers, Jason Isbell, Colter Wall) and Texas scene making it to radio (see Cody Johnson). Even Hardy, who wrote most of the songs youre referencing, has sang about an accidental pregnancy, a song about trucks where he actually tells a story, and about his lost best friend.

The reason being is most likely because of the environment music needs to survive in.

You would definitely know that there would not just be one person being unjustly harasser, but pretty much the entire music industry would be gone.

There was not even one person of color even at the location which happens to be his private residence. It may seem petty to you, but I just happen to think that in order for someone to have used a racial slur of any kind it's pretty dependent on someone of another race be present, or at least on the phone, or text, maybe facetime.. for sure though, there must  be at least one member of another race present don't you think? It was a drunk playful attempt between buddies in a private conversation.  So I got to ask... In my humble opinion, if the problem arises from the use of this word and it's so hurtful and feared. Why have we as society chosen to on  daily basis to pick and choose who has the right to use such hurtful language? Think on it for a minute.. Cause as soon as you come back with there is a exception for anyone at all to use it, and implanting a policy on another race of any kind taking away their right to speech... You have just become a racist and that is truly disgusting. Every person is born equal and the constitution provides everyone with the same essential rights. That being said how are you suggesting we now change all of that and just start choosing who has the right or not to do anything.. Kinda seems like its backswords and digressing back to the past doing it that  way.

Trump was saying the exact same things Fauci was saying. Thats a fact. If you wanna put the blame on somebody, Fauci should be the primary target.  

He did not call the virus a hoax. Thats been debunked already. https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/oct/08/ask-politifact-are-you-sure-donald-trump-didnt-cal/

You also sound like you never paid attention in Government class. The president does not have the authority for a nationwide lockdown. He did what he was able, in blocking off travel from China(which was immediately called xenophobic by the democrats) and Europe. Its up to the states and each governor to decide about lockdowns and masks. 

The governors, and Trump for that matter, have every right to challenge the election results if they wish to, as its within their power to do so. 

Lockdowns have killed more people than theyve saved. Fact. The WHO now has changed their tune about lockdowns saying that theyre bad and do more harm than good.","17_2_3_1_1_1"

Kind of funny how you people think Trump doesn't have the authority to order a lockdown, but does have the authority to overturn elections. Typical moron conservative mindset. We hate big government unless it OUR big government. Pathetic. As pathetic as your worship of a sore loser, a sad narcissist who literally lies about everything to inflate his own ego.
And it's not even about lockdowns....although the countries that had lockdowns have massively fewer cases and deaths than we do. It's about just taking common sense measures to control a deadly disease which has no treatment...something neither Trump or any of his Republican cronies have any interest in.
So, you say lockdowns kill more people than they save? What fucking planet do you live on?

South Korea: Population: 51.7 million. Cases: 41,736. Deaths: 578. (locked down)

Taiwan: population: 23.4 million. Cases: 733. Deaths: 7. (locked down)

Texas: population: 29 million. Cases: 1,403,687. Deaths: 23,967. (not locked down)

Florida: Population: 21.4 million. Cases: 1,116,973. Deaths: 20,047. (not locked down)

See a contrast there, between countries that actually cared, that actually took measures to control this disease, instead of pretending it doesn't exist?

No, the president himself doesnt have the authority for a nationwide lockdown. Thats a fact. 

Any president has the right to challenge the election results, as do the states. Thats a fact. 

Taiwan? Under control of China, controlled by the CCP. An ignorant comparison of two countries that are marginally different. 

Yes, lockdowns have done more harm than good: https://www.google.com/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/10/06/medical-experts-lockdowns-do-more-harm-than-good/amp/

The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. The countries you mentioned dont have that. 
Lockdowns are unconstitutional, seeing as they violate the peoples rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Its literally the first amendment. Even if lockdowns did work, it wouldnt matter, as theyre unconstitutional.

You say that ""a frequency of 1 out of every 200 words is just not enough to be a defining stereotype of a genre"". To prove this statement, you would have to compare lyrical trends in other genres or even in everyday conversation. What if rap, rock, and reggae only have a reference to alcohol every 1 in 400 words? What if the average conversation includes a reference to alcohol every 1 in 100 words? Either of these findings would provide a basis of comparing the 1 in 200 number you have, which otherwise has no meaning to the average person.","16"

You don't have to forgive anybody. But the history of country music is full of artists who battled their demons very publicly, not just the three I mentioned who happened to end up doing hard time. We know these guys aren't/weren't saints, but in a genre known for it's songs of pain and heartbreak, there's little doubt that Hank Williams, George Jones, Keith Whitley, etc. were on a first name basis with the subjects they were singing about. That alone doesn't atone for anything they've done, but it does make them more relatable.

Wallen seems to be a guy who gets drunk and does stupid shit quite frequently. We've had plenty of those in country music, so that alone isn't enough to remove him from my playlist. But he was never on my playlist to begin with because of the shallowness of his music and the lack of any elements I would associate with country, or any other genre I'm a fan of for that matter.","3_5_1"

I'd like them to stop on their own, or alternatively, large companies stop giving ground based on a small, vocal subset of ""activists"" on social media. 

&gt;What is the alternative way to hold people accountable for being assholes? 

Sometimes there isn't if they aren't committing a crime. A group of idiots trying to cancel people on Twitter are within their right to do so. I'm within my right to call them out; everybody else is free to have an opinion, pick a side, or to not do anything at all. 

I think hoping to hold people accountable for being assholes (as opposed to being criminals which there is a clear mechanism) is a symptom of the problem here. Speech is almost never a crime. Cancel culture is free speech, even if I dislike it.","2_2_2_1_1_1_1_1"
