"5","rap","Fr tho.Most of his new stuff just feels lazy"
"6","rap","Usually after rappers get rich the music quality just declines and this is what happened with ski mask. Happened with polo g too"
"7","rap","2019 dababy was the man, after that the success got to him"
"8","rap","Polo G been in the game for 2 maybe 3 years, he has plenty of time left. I’m not judging Polo yet because I know he can do better and probably will. His recent song is pretty good imo"

"19","rap","[removed]"
"20","rap","Big Sean"
"21","rap","Yeah sometimes I get sick of his music but then I listen again in a few months and I get hooked again"
"22","rap","I still listen to them but their newest albums don’t compare to the old ones. Like Eternal Gray. None of their albums can compete"
"23","rap","Of course you got -1 votes. I agree cuz like MOV4, SKINS, and Bad Vibes Forever were disappointing. Especially MOV4. But I did love that one song One Minute with Kanye West on SKINS and He Diddy! on MOV4. I remember liking Juice Wrld’s new album but I haven’t listening to him in a long time. Also, this sub can’t take criticism"
"24","rap","Yeah maybe, it’s just my own opinion, he influenced the whole trap scene think about it. Lean, dreadlocks, the beats, his voice idk it just seems he’s the one who influenced the main artists of today’s rap"
"25","rap","Fat joe

I don't think he's all the way good in the head tbh"
"26","rap","Eminem.

Didn't enjoy any of his albums as much since MMLP2 came out. First half of Kamikaze was great, and he had a few tracks here and there which I liked, but idk man that robotic and stacatto flow he adopts just tends to get old so fast."
"27","rap","Good music &amp; bars over religious sad music &amp; billioner business and industry talk..

I'm not surprised people want the good &amp; fun vibes lol I'd vote for drake and wayne too"
"28","rap","It's spotify for me, it only sucks if it's not premium"
"29","rap","What are doing??? This is out right blasphemy. You can not talk bad about Juice Wrld. Think about the Fortnite kids you’re shaming"
"30","rap","Thats just not correct at all. The Off Season sounds WAY different than KOD."
"31","rap","Definitely wanna be honest here, the rapping/ flow you had needs some work but your singing voice has some pretty high potential. Keep practicing and trying more Melodie’s and maybe even some vocal lessons (you can even find exercises on YouTube) and I think you can do some great things with your voice"
"32","rap","No, no. Hes right."
"33","rap","Same. His album ADHD was kinda wack too"
"34","rap","Three six &gt;&gt; trap influence"
"35","rap","I hate that what you said is true about J Cole. Fuck you, take my upvote"
"36","rap","They all <U+0001F410>s"
"37","rap","Yeah I think they’re basically just trying to be Three 6 though. Horrorcore rap isn’t really explored as much as it should be, but the Flatlinerz, Gravediggaz, Twiztid, Three 6 Mafia, and ICP don’t sound alike whereas $uicideboy$ feel like they’re trying to be just another Three 6."
"38","rap","Fr fr"
"39","rap","Blues &gt;&gt; rap influence then. I don’t get where you tryna go with that thinking bro <U+0001F923>"
"40","rap","I think he lost his way at Revival in my opinion. As much as I still love Eminem, he should retire. I don’t think he has much to say. He just makes dad jokes now in his bars"
"41","rap","Since the cypher with JID it became very apparent to me the lack of skill Ski possesses. I got second-hand embarrassment just from witnessing that shit.

He has a handful of good tracks, nothing to write home about really."
"42","rap","Still sucks"
"43","rap","U mentioned lean n beats"
"44","rap","yeaaah it was by far not the only one on the album,  but it was the worst one.

Also, tnx"
"45","rap","Cole. Music is so boring."
"46","rap","Right? MTBMB is straight up unlistenable to me. My God his lyrics, cadence, flow and production are straight up garbage on this record. It honestly baffles me that people argue it to be one of his best albums.

I still cant get over the fact that he got on a track with Conway The Machine and rapped how he did lmao"
"47","rap","Danny Brown"
"48","rap","Conway the machine sucks too. Eminem was good until 2006. Last decent shit was on the Re-Up mixtape. Without weed, his music making ability ain't shit, unfortunately. That cookie monster flow and voice is trash <U+0001F5D1>."
"49","rap","Remove the word ""complex"" from your comment and you're right."
"50","rap","Conway the machine does not suck lmao. I'm tryna see who you putting over Conway in current rappers"
"51","rap","Opinion"
"52","rap","Bandcamp. Buy independent artists music."
"53","rap","Lolol. I believe he was shit since he made that album with the rapping ""dog with an accent"". Since then, he's been a disgrace to hiphop. Can't be top 5 of all time if he's had more garbage albums than good albums. Started well with SSLP, MMLP, EMShow, rest of his work is trash."
"54","rap","Bruh. You must think his ""gritty flow"" makes him good. 

He's trash. Sounding gritty don't mean shit if you're trash. I put anyone over Conway.  

Edit: Conways bars are shit. I nod at sounding like a 90s/early 2000's emcee. Doesn't mean he's good though. Lol."
"55","rap","Your rap vocal needs a lot of work and content it comes across a bit whiney and nerdy my guy and it makes it hard to relate/believe what your saying. woth your singing voice you're the man look at Damon Albarn with the Gorillaz newer stuff (after 2017) you could do stuff like that man. You've a gift and it's in the hooks you're writing."
"56","rap","Ok"
"57","rap","I was definitely going for nerdy but I appreciate the feedback. I am a hippie soul white dude from wi with glasses so it’s kinda my vibe also I can rap it a lot more convincing, my mic can’t handle when I go hard lol. Had to make what I got work but I’ll definitely be fine tuning it"
"58","rap","Yeah but not only lean and beats, Wayne took over south rap for a moment and it’s not because ugk or three 6 or anyone started something that they popularized it you feel me"
"59","rap","Name people.

Tf is a ""gritty flow"" lmfao. It's becoming very clear to me that you haven't listened to his stuff. Conway would wash anybody on a track."
"60","rap","Great song"
"61","rap","TVs in the Range, I'm into nice thangs
I slang weed, cocaine and heroin
50 Cent, that's my name"
"62","rap","Nerdy can be cool man nerds run the world but the delivery is a bit clunky and the vocal comes off as just a bit corny and forced my man no hate. Own who you are dude I love that no problems with that part of it man just I know you can dip deeper with the content.  is that your real speaking accent also? It feels a bit neutral/Google translate on the beat"
"63","rap","Gritty. Means his flow is choppy as fuck. Gritty voice as well. Doesn't make him harder, or good. Just makes him a shit emcee with a gritty voice, and choppy flow. 

Who's better than this bum? Everyone, but let me say one person. I'll take Mos Def from back in the day to shit on him. Someone from now? Shit, Logic will shit on him. With the flow and lyrics, and he's been inactive. Everyone says J.Cole, he's decent, but boring over all all his work sounds the same.

Edit: Even Drag-on. I'll take this washed up emcee (he has a new album out) and even he can shit on your boy."
"64","rap","[removed]"
"65","rap","IMO relapse is a 10, and mmlp2 was pretty solid. I can see why people wouldn’t like those ones though (I also loved MTBMB though so we probably have pretty different tastes then lol)"
"66","rap","Like I said lol. My mic is 40 bucks, If I was in a studio I have a different idea for delivery I do appreciate the Feedback 100% and know exactly what you’re talking about tho loll also I’ll mention I was reading it off a paper as it’s not fully memorized yet so that makes it clunky also"
"67","rap","He has like 200+ songs and has like 10 were he raps fast. If you include features it’s like 15-20. Idk were the “he only raps fast” narrative comes from"
"68","rap","You must be a modern Eminem listener, so you can't compare those to actual good pieces of work. Understandable."
"69","rap","100%"
"70","rap","LMFAO

I somehow just knew you would be one of those guys.

Respect for Mos Def. One of the greatest. But I cant believe you really think Logic would wash Conway lmao

Logic struggles to even make decent songs these days. Cole a decent pick. I dont think he would out bar Conway but he would come closer than most."
"71","rap","I liked it personally listed to it for a min, but forgettable"
"72","rap","I do prefer his 1999-2009 stuff to his new stuff still. I am still a relatively new fan of Eminem (and rap in general) since I only started around September last year so maybe you are right."
"73","rap","Bruh. Logic has talent that is 20,000 times that of Conways. I said it before, I'll say it again. Shit, even the bum Blueface is better than Conway."
"74","rap","Tell me a Conway line that is ""shit"" lmao"
"75","rap","All of his songs, collectively. His group (or label or whatever the fuck they are) ain't shit either. <U+0001F90C>"
"76","rap","Bruh. You must be a child."
"77","rap","The majority of my songs are Indy singing songs without rap. But I really do enjoy rapping as well https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPd2HbDop/"
"78","rap","Yea. A child.  You sound like a kid that doesn't know shit about Hip/Hop. Anywho, we're all entitled to our opinions. Griselda and your boy Conway ain't shit."
"79","rap","Cant think of a line, don't even know the name of his group. Just admit you havent listened to any of their stuff."
"80","rap","DSavage and lowkey Duwap Kaine, really fw them early on. I just feel like i’m waiting for some thing more"
"81","rap","Bro u really down bad"
"82","rap","- Listens to Logic

- Thinks hes a hip-hop expert

LMFAO"
"83","rap","Listens to Logic? Are you serious? I've been listening for over 20 years, and I'm an emcee. Are you a teenager,  bro?

Conway is ass. Live with it."
"84","rap","totally agree on that"
"85","rap","[deleted]"
"86","rap","Dude said Drag-on lmao dude had one decent album 20 years ago.

Give you Nas, that's it. As if Kanye would ever out bar Conway Haha, not even a lyricist"
"87","rap","Repetitive the group"
"88","rap","That's the funny shit. Even Drag-on could shit on him. Drag-on dropped an album last year FYI, child."
"89","rap","fun fact it wasn't 9 it was 5, but they used the number 9 because  it sounded better"
"90","rap","His first album only bro, I was so hyped for it and loved it. Everything after that I just don't see it. Strongly believe he has a lot of talent but it falls short on his music imo"
"91","rap","I have. I stopped because IT SUCKS."
"92","rap","Yeah I know he did, shit was ass."
"93","rap","Better than all of Conways shit."
"94","rap","Gucci is a guy who on features I love , but his albums are just meh."
"95","rap","Okay man. This has been fun, if you really dont like it thats fair enough lol.

Thanks for the discussion lol, respect."
"96","rap","I guess you just prefer fast flows, that's cool too."
"97","rap","Lol. Atleast we agree Eminem sucks. <U+0001F44D>"

There was a huge net label scene filled with tons of micro house, dub house, dub techno, and more, but they didn't jump on the Beatport bandwagon and established artists who got rocked when EFA folded didn't jump on the bandwagon either.  New dudes like Deadmau5 did.

"172","electronicmusic","You guessed it. I've heard Splazsh, it's kind of a classic 2010s microhouse album. The reason why I'm looking for newer microhouse is that I've had the impression for a while now that all the best stuff from the genre came out in the first half of the 2010s, and I was hoping that someone on Reddit might point to something more recent that I've overlooked."

Pablo Bolivar might be right up your alley. Also check out the Sekoia label and YouTube channel.

John Tejada does a bunch of microhouse-ish stuff and goes way back to the 1990s.

Also check out Thomas Fehlmann (from The Orb and other stuff).

Monolake.

Also check out Pressure Traxx: https://www.youtube.com/c/PressureTraxx

Another old schooler that dabbles into microhouse and minimal spaces is Mark Farina, especially some of his live DJ sets dating back to the 90s. It's not all about Mushroom Jazz."

"187","electronicmusic","I've had the pleasure of seeing him at one of those city wide music festival kind of things where they do venue takeovers.

It was in an amazing underground and highly polished concrete and modern medium sized event space of the sort used for art shows, modern performance arts and apparently bougie weddings or private events for those post industrial tastes.

My friend and I knew of Andy Stott from the darker and more experimental side of things but also were into the dancier stuff too, and since we're old jaded ravers we were really pleasantly surprised by how young the crowd was and how into it they were, and how crowded it got.

The guy drops a mean, mean heavy dub with a great sense of progression and tempo, that sort of slow build where you just kind of start off wobbling and nodding your head but totally hooked, and then at some point you suddenly realize you're dancing and don't know when it started kind of progressions.

I danced my fool ass off that night and stomped that concrete until my feet were bruised. People got *nuts* and it ended up being one of the best dance sessions I had at the festival.

In my memories I think he might have been second only to the AtomTM live custom hardware set where he beat everyone up with super heavy Teutonic breakbeats and machine noises."

"206","country","Definitely check out Confederate Railroad. They are a country/rock/southern rock band.

Brooks &amp; Dunn is a country duo that early on was sometimes considered rock. Their first two albums are some of my favorite.

Eric Church ""The Outsiders"" is a metal song. Also the whole album ""Chief"" has some rock elements and is very fun.

A lot of Jason Aldean's stuff has solid to great guitar work. ""She's Country"" and ""The Only Way I Know"" are probably the best two examples but basically any up tempo song he has done. And I would put Justin Moore in a similar category. He did a cover of ""Home Sweet Home"" by Mötley Crüe that is very good and Vince Neil sings with him. So listen to that if they are on your radar at all.

There are a lot 90's neotraditional artists that share characteristics with 80's hair metal since mainstream was shifting at the time. Travis Tritt might be good try. I would start with ""T-R-O-U-B-L-E"" or ""Put Some Drive In Your Country"", Tracy Lawrence is great too ""If The Good Die Young"" is one of my favorite up tempo songs of his."

There's a ton of sub genres in country, so have fun diving in! You'll find most country music that's not of the pop variety has very relatable lyrics if you're coming from punk/metal/rock. 
You'll quickly graduate to George Jones, Waylon Jennings, Johnny paycheck, Merle haggard..."
"269","country","Came here to suggest the same thing"
"270","country","Koe Wetzel for sure, his music is like a combination of grunge, punk, and country and it seems like it’d be right up your alley. check out “kuntry &amp; wistern”, “sundy or mundy”, and “ragweed” to start off"
"271","country","Probably [Hank III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkzSyvCl9ic) is where you want to go man.  He's played with guys from Pantera.  . I think it might get you the sort of what you're looking for.  Let the song build up.
